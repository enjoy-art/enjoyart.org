## Post

Content is modelled using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), which allows you to define your own content schema and use it to generate typed content objects. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

### Frontmatter

## Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Netlify**
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)â€™s Next.js runtime configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR), `next/images`, etc.

See [Next.js on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime) for suggested configuration values and more details.

**Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.**

1. Add `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`. See [static exports documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration) for more information.
2. Comment out `headers()` from `next.config.js`.
3. Add `unoptimized: true` to the `images` key in `next.config.js`:

   Alternatively, to continue using `next/image`, you can use an alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai. See [image optimization documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) for more details.

4. Remove `api` folder and components which call the server-side function such as the Newsletter component. Not technically required and the site will build successfully, but the APIs cannot be used as they are server-side functions.
5. Run `yarn build`. The generated static content is in the `out` folder.
6. Deploy the `out` folder to your hosting service of choice or run `npx serve out` to view the website locally.

**Note**: Deploying on Github pages require addition modifications to the base path. Please refer to the FAQ for more information.

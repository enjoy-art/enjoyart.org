The \"Wanderer above the Sea of Fog\" shows a man standing upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer and gazing out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog which stretches out into the distance indefinitely. \n\nThe painting is the emblem of romanticism, representing self-reflection or contemplation of life's path, about one's own rapport of one's life expectations, Nature and uncontrollable events.

The “Wanderer above the sea of fog” shows a middle-aged man standing on top of a mountain, over a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer and gazing out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog which stretches out into the distance indefinitely. As he is on top, he has reached a summit. Yet, what lies ahead is mysterious and remains hidden.

This painting by Caspar David Friedrich has become the emblem of Romanticism, representing self-reflection or contemplation of life’s path, of the way forward, of all that can be done, of one’s own rapport to one’s life expectations, Nature and uncontrollable events.

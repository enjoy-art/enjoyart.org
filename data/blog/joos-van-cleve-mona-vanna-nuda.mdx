The half-figure of a woman with bare breasts is a paraphrase of Leonardo's Mona Lisa. The original inspiration is Italian, the character of the work Dutch, walnut wood was often used in France. The combination of these three elements suggests that we have before us a \"product\" of the Fontainebleau School. The base consists of natural chalk, used in the Alps. Joos van Cleve, an admirer of Leonardo, who stayed in France at the court of King Francis I, probably between 1529 and 1534, is considered to be the author of this - perhaps deliberately created - Leonardo's forgery. The prototype of our work was Leonardo's lost painting Mona Vanna boredom, known from numerous imitations of Leonardo's Lombard followers. A painting from the Paolo Weiss collection in Rome probably served as an immediate model. The type of depiction of a woman with bare breasts led to the opinion that it is a representation of the mistress of King Francis I.\nVan Cleve was active in the years following Mona Lisa’s creation. Though the figure portrayed in van Cleve’s painting bears no resemblance to Leonardo’s Mona Lisa, the artist was known to mimic themes and techniques of Leonardo, in this case the positioning of the figure and the delicate brushwork reminiscent of Leonardo’s sfumato.

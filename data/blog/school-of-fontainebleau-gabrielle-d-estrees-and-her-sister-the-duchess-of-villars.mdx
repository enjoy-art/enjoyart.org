The painting portrays Gabrielle d’Estrées, mistress of King Henry IV of France, sitting nude in a bath, holding a ring. Her sister Julienne-Hyppolite-Joséphine sits nude beside her and pinches d’Estrées’ right nipple. Each of the sister is wearing one earring of a same pair. The nipple-pinching gesture has been interpreted as a symbolic announcement that Gabrielle is pregnant. This interpretation is reinforced by the scene of the young woman sewing in the background, who could be working on preparing baby clothes. 

The ring that Gabrielle holds is said to be Henry’s coronation ring, which he is said to given to her as a token of his love and as a promise to mary her shortly before she died at only 26 years old while pregnant of a fourth child with Henry IV.

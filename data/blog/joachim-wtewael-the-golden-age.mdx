The Utrecht painter Joachim Wtewael was among the most sophisticated of Netherlandish Mannerists, as is evident from this exquisite painting on copper intended for a well-read collector. The subject is taken from the opening pages of the classical author Ovid's Metamorphoses (8 CE), which describe a time before the ages of silver, bronze, and iron when \"spring was everlasting . . . streams of sweet nectar flowed,\" and mankind, \"without a law,\" did right and lived contentedly.

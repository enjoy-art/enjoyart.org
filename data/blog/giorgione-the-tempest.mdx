\"La Tempesta\" is mysterious in its meaning- \nA woman sitting in the grass suckling a baby, but with an unnatural pose- instead of having the baby on her lap, she has it on her side...\nThe bridge in the middle: what does it connect?\nThe storm is coming up, the lightning in the sky: is that God's wrath? for what reason? is that Nature happening?\n\n\"La Tempesta\" is echoed in Nicolas Poussin's \"Et in Arcadia ego\", and in Manet's \"Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe\".\n\nGiorgone had a lasting influence on painting: together with Titian who lived much longer than him, he founded the Venetian Renaissance school, with its distinct use of colors (ardent, glowing, and melting intensity); he introduced esoteric mythology in European painting; he had a different, less deferent, rapport to people who commissioned him to paint their portrait; and his paintings of landscape led to it becoming a genre in its own right.

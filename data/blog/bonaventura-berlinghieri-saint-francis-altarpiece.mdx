The Berlinghieri family exerted considerable influence on Florentine painting before Cimabue. \nBonaventura is most famous for this life-sized altarpiece painted in tempera on wood panel in the Italo-Byzantine style several scenes from the saint's life and in the center a 1.5 meter-tall St Francis who is barefoot and simply dressed to show his humbleness and somewhat floating about in a spiritual way. The Byzantine style is notable- a saint, an elongated figure front-facing, a flat gold background, etc.

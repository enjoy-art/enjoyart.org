Marat was the artist's friend and co-revolutionary (radical Montagnard). Marat was killed in his bath by Charlotte Corday on 13 July 1793. The murderer who said she killed one man to save many throusands more, is absent from the painting, making it all about Marat having been lost. David uses many techniques, including some used by past artists to depict Jesus, to implement his message that Marat was a good, sincere man who deserves to be remembered as a benevolent hero- the absence of a background, the modest interior and simple textiles; him working; the dedication "to Marat" showing simple, great respect; the face and body bathed in a soft, glowing light.

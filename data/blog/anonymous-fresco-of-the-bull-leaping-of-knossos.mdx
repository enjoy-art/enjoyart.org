The Minoan civilization (the name derives from the mythical King Minos with his labyrinth and the Minotaur) on the island of Crete and nearby islands began c.2000 BCE and declined from c.1450 to 1100 BCE perhaps due to a major volcanic eruption in Santorini. It was the first advanced civilization in Europe with building complexes, sophisticated art, writing systems, and a trading network in the Near East. Minoan art was characterized by its bright colors and intricate patterns. Frescos decorated the walls of the palaces and homes of the elite, depicting scenes of social life, such as bull leaping, dance, and sporting events, and mythological subjects, such as the bull-headed Minotaur and the griffin, a creature with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle. \n\nThe bull-leaping fresco depicts a ritual or sporting event that was important to the Minoans, although the exact significance of the scene is not fully understood and is not realistic when taking all the elements together. The bull's body has an elongated form with extended legs to indicate movement. A male youth (convention is males' skin is painted dark and females' skin pale) is shown leaping on the bull's back with one woman in front holding the bull's horns firmly and another woman at the back, perhaps to catch the leaper.

The painting \"Snow Storm- Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth\" depicts a paddle steamer caught in a snow storm. Turner is representing the natural world unmastered by mankind and exploring the effects of the elements and the battle of the forces of the nature. Turner worked first as a watercolorist,  much later with oils such as in this oil painting. Turner's tints and shades of colors are painted in different layers of color with each  brushstrokes adding texture to the painting. The silvery pale light that surrounds the boat draws the viewer into the painting and the spiral. The smoke from the steamboat spreads out over the sky, creating shapes like the waves.\nTurner and Constable will both be great sources of inspiration for the Impressionists.

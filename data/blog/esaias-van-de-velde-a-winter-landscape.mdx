The painting \"A Winter Landscape\" captures the atmosphere of a late winter’s day in Northern Europe with its soft, muted colors, the blue, warmer sky filtering through the white, winter clouds- cold but not biting cold, melting snow, burnt grass, muddy, slippery pathway. Unlike Brugel's incident-packed, bird’s-eye view of a winter scene, we are part of the scene by being on a level with the characters and the landscape.

The Promenade painting is the first created during this period, and the first where Macke used the motif of a walk in a park near a bridge and water. Decisive for Macke was the influence of the contemporary French painting, above all the work of Robert Delaunay. For Macke, this event was a turning point in understanding the role of light and color in painting. According to his wife, Elisabeth Erdmann-Macke, in the his final paintings there can be noticed the \"airiness of colors, wonderful luminosity, especially in the green tones of trees, transparency of heavenly blue, sunspots on the ground, where shades change from shining yellow to deep red-brown\".[3] He painted figures of people without sharp contrasts, and without outlining them with a clearly defined contour.\n\nBack in 1910, Macke had defined the goal of his work- \"to praise nature.\" In Hilterfingen, the old motives of his paintings and sketches took on a more intense level. Macke created what could be considered the \"Paradise\" of the modern man with leisurely walks through the city streets, serene relaxation in the park, sailing and swimming.[4]

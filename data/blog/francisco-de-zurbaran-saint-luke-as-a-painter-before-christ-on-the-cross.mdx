In \"Saint Luke as a Painter before Christ on the Cross\", Zurbarán might have painted himself as Luke who, besides being one of the four evangelists, is thought to have been a physician and a painter.\n\nLuke is shown standing to the side, observing the scene as Jesus is crucified. The focus is very much on Luke who is larger and gets more light. His respectful demeanor, his half open mouth as talking to Jesus, and his hand on his heart show how grateful Luke is to Jesus for his sacrifice.\n\nThe absence of aureola and the very human traits of Luke humanizes the religious scene, making it more palatable for the viewer.

![ Anonymous - Hooker 24 (Leaning sensuality)](/static/images/10245.jpg)

* Title: Hooker 24 (Leaning)
* Artist:  Anonymous (?-?)
* Date: c.2000
* Medium: Oil on canvas ?
* Dimensions: 44 x 60 cm ?
* Location: ?

The painting shows a nude woman, bent forward, filling almost the entire canvas. Her back and buttocks curve toward the viewer in the foreground, while her head is turned over her shoulder so she looks straight out of the picture. 

The painting clearly invites a sexualized reading, echoing pin-up or pornographic poses. At the same time, the heavy, swirling background and weird skin colors turn the body into a set of shapes and color fields, almost like an abstract painting that just happens to be a nude. The pose encourages voyeurism, but the woman’s direct eye contact can feel accusatory or defiant, as if she’s catching you looking. The painting’s impact comes from that clash: it is visually lush and sensuous, but also a bit unsettling. It pulls you in with color and form while simultaneously making you question why the body is posed this way and what it means to look at it.

Information on Wikipedia indicates the painting's medium is oil on canvas and its size is 44 cm high by 66 cm wide. But precise information about the painting is unlcear, including the title of the painting, its current location, and the name of the artist. On Wikipedia it is suggetsed the title of the painting may be Hooker 24 or Nooker but it is unclear, hence the choice to call it also "Leaning".

Masaccio’s fresco, “The expulsion from the garden of Eden”, is seen as a landmark in the beginning of the Renaissance with usage of linear perspective, with full and muscular bodies, with nudity, with characters showing emotions and unique features, with usage of light and shade. Also, Masaccio represents Eve in  deeply felt pain exploring the meaning of the expulsion on a more personal level. Masaccio influenced greatly Domenico Ghirlandaio, who was Michelangelo’s teacher.

The triptych is a founding work in the Early Netherlandish style. The central panel represents the Annunciation.\n\nThe painting is set in a Northern European, Flemish bourgeois house's living room with so many details of the life of then- the two chimneys, the copper pot, the long bench, etc.\n\nThe iconography contains complex religious symbolism including many symbols of Mary's virginity- the lilies, the white towel, the small windows on the side and the half-closed windows at the rear. \n\nThe breakthroughs include an attempt at linear perspective, the work on the draperies, the work on great details, like the vase and the bougeoir,  and the delicate faces.

\"Landscape with a Footbridge\" is claimed to have been the first pure landscape painted in oil. Altdorfer placed a large tree at the center of the landscape, making it the central axis and focus within the piece. The footbridge's horizontality opposes the tree's verticality. A mysterious atmostphere exudes- the manoir looks somewhat unkept and the dead tree behind it adds to this sense of abadonment; the footbridge does not reach the manoir on the left (perhaps a raised drawbridge) and on the other end of the footbridge, there is no apparent way, just trees which together make you wonder what the bridge is for; and the wild, lush vegetation accentuates the absence of a human in this painting; as if Nature was taking over.

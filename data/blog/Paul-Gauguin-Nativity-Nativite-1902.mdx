"Nativité" is a pivotal work by Paul Gauguin, painted during his second stay in the Polynesian islandsn where he will die the following year. The painting reimagines the traditional Nativity scene, placing it in a Polynesian context. Gauguin merges Christian iconography with Polynesian cultural elements, creating a unique fusion that reflects his spiritual and artistic exploration.

The work captures Gauguin’s ambivalence toward French colonialism and the Catholic Church, while also expressing his search for authenticity and a deeper connection to Polynesian culture. Painted in 1902, "Nativité" reflects Gauguin’s retreat to the Marquesas Islands, where he sought isolation from French colonial society and marked his deepening alignment with indigenous cultures.

The painting is linked to Gauguin’s manuscript "L’Esprit moderne et le catholicisme", where he critiques the Catholic Church and explores broader cultural and spiritual themes.

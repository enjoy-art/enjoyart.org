The painting commemorates the Spanish uprising against Napoleon's troops. Those had been accepted in Spain to bring about liberalism but were rejected when Napoleon's brother Joseph was made king of Spain. On May 2, 1808, a Madrid crowd killed some French soldiers. Before dawn the next day, French commander Murat rounded up and shot hundreds of Madrilenes. Ensued a five-year guerilla war before the French withdrew.\nThe painting depicts two groups of men- one a rigidly poised firing squad and the other a disorganized group of captives held at gunpoint. The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer. The painting uses codes from  martyrdom in Christian art- dramatic use of chiaroscuro, the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution, and the posture reminiscent of crucified Jesus including a stigma on the victim's right hand.

The \"Soap Bubble\" depicts a young man blowing a soap bubble. This picture is Chardin's first figural painting (using a model) and it was exhibited at the 1739 Paris Salon. \nPainting soap bubbles requires great technical skill and allows for a play on colors and transparency. The magic that comes with soap bubbles appeals to all generations. It's been speculated that Chardin was inspired by 17th-century Dutch paintings where soap bubbles served as allusions to the transience of life, such as Adriaen Hanneman's \"Two Boys Blowing Bubbles\", c. 1630.

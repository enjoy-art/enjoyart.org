![ Anonymous - Swimmers and super being](/static/images/10851.jpg)

* Title: Swimmers and super being
* Artist:  Anonymous (-)
* Date: c.7000 BCE
* Medium: Cave painting
* Dimensions: 

The cave contains Neolithic rock paintings and gets its name from the depictions of people with their limbs bent as if they were swimming. The drawings include those of giraffe and hippopotamus. They are estimated to have been created as early as 10,000 years ago during the the African humid period (15,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE), when the Sahara was significantly greener and wetter than it is today. The larger person depicted is impressive, represented as a super being, tall and muscular with a tiny head and with its joints and fingers clearly depicted.

The painting depicts the decisive moment in the tale of Cupid and Psyche, from Apuleius’ Metamorphosis, when the maiden, driven by curiosity and encouraged by the evil sisters, decides to learn the identity of the mysterious lover who visits her every day at sunset without showing his face.\nThe painting represents a famous episode narrated by Apuleius in The Golden Ass (Metamorphoses). The extraordinarily beautiful Psyche decides to discover the identity of her young lover by entering his room carrying a razor and an oil lamp. As she approaches the body of the handsome god, she accidently lets fall a drop of boiling oil onto the boy’s shoulder. Upon awakening, he flies away.\nZucchi was renowned for his depictions of mythological subjects. With this work, he proves himself to be a sophisticated painter in step with his times, drawing on Michelangelo Buonarroti and the other Tuscan sculptors of the era, as well as the Nordic tradition in terms of the precision in such details as the flowers, jewellery and fabrics, often painted with the help of his brother Francesco.

The painting "The white and the black" represents a nude white woman asleep on a bed with a fully dressed black woman sitting by her side smoking a cigarette. 

It's worth noting the contrast between Félix Vallotton's painting and ’[Manet’s "Olympia"](https://www.enjoyart.org/blog/edouard-manet-olympia)- Olympia awake and controlling the viewer with her gaze versus Félix's model asleep; the black maid of Olympia in the back holding deferently a bouqet versus the maid being here in the front of stage smoking a cigarette; the elaborate wall fabric and bedding of Olympia's room versus the plain green wall and plain white sheets in this case.

Félix Vallotton's painting highlights equality between people and difference in social status.

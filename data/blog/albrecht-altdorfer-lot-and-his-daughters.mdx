Altdorfer uses the often depicted scene of Lot's daughters getting their father drunk in order to have offspring from him as an excuse for a large nude depiction. With this work, which was created at the very end of his artistic career, the painter moved far away from the art of the “Danube School” and developed towards the style of international mannerism.

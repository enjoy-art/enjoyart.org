In the 16th-century painting "Lot and his daughters" by Altdorfer, the artist utilizes the frequently depicted scene of Lot's daughters getting their father drunk to conceive offspring as a pretext for a substantial nude portrayal. This artwork, crafted at the culmination of his artistic journey, marks a significant departure from the aesthetics of the "Danube School," as the painter gravitates towards the stylistic influences of international mannerism.

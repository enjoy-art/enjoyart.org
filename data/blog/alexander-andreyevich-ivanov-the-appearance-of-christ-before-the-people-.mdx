Ivanov devoted over two decades of his life to "The Appearance of Christ before the People", a monumental painting of 540 x 750 cm which was meticulously painted in bright colors and a brushstroke reminding us of Italian renaissance, while the drama and composition are distinctly Romantic. 

The painting drew on the biblical episode of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist in the river Jordan. In the painting, John the Baptist in the foreground is pointing to Jesus who is still at a distance and is walking towards the diverse of figures representing all social classes, ages, and ethnicities. Those figures represent humanity's response to the divine presence, ranging from awe and reverence to skepticism and indifference. 

Ivanov explored here the themes of faith, redemption, and the human condition. At a time of social and political upheaval in Russia, Ivanov's portrayal of Christ's redemptive mission resonated with audiences seeking solace. The painting seemed to be a call for the Russian people to unite in Christianity.

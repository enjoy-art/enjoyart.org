In \"Saint Francis in Ecstasy\", Bellini made a very refined, detailed, precise, and colorful painting. The attention put on the landscape is remarkable with great effort in representing the rocky mountain, with the interstices and the weeds growing inside.\n\nGiovanni Bellini was considered to have moved Venetian painting toward a more sensuous and coloristic style. With the use of slow-drying oil paints, he created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. His sumptuous coloring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had great effect on his pupils Giorgione and Titian.

In this icon, Mary is facing the viewer directly, in full length with her hands in a praying position with her arms and hands outspread and palms up (Orant). The medallion showing the image of Christ as a child in front of her chest signifies that Mary is the God-bearer and that she can intercede in favor of prayers.

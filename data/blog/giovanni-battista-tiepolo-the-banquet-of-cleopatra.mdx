\"The Banquet of Cleopatra\" represents an episode in the love affair between the Roman consul Mark Antony (83–30 BCE) and the Egyptian queen, Cleopatra (69–30 BCE)- Cleopatra bets that she can organize a feast more over-the-top than Mark Antony. Tiepolo shows the dramatic moment at the end of the banquet when Cleopatra wins the wager with her trump card- she removes one of her earrings carrying a precious pearl to drop it into a cup of vinegar and drink it once the pearl has dissolved. But here is no joy in the painting: the main characters look in conflict and the servants and onlookers grouped around the table and standing on the balcony add to the bad vibes of the scene. \n\nThe grandeur of the composition is clearly inspired by Venitian Paolo Veronese's  \"The Wedding at Cana\". The display of excessive opulence is typically rococo: the variety of food and plates to carry them, the refinement and variety of clothes worn, the wide range of colors used, the details in the architecture and interior design such as the beautifully tiled floor and the collection of characters (people of all stages and wealth, moors, soldiers,a dwarf, a dog, etc).

Hugo Simberg's "The wounded angel" is one of the most famous Finnish paintings. Like other Simberg works, the atmosphere is melancholic- the angelic central figure with her bandaged forehead and bloodied wing, the sombre clothing of her two youthful bearers. The right-hand figure's gaze is fixated beyond and to the right of the viewer. The healthy boys are carrying the injured girl angel towards the Blind Girls' School and the Home for Cripples. She clutches a bunch of snowdrops, symbolic of healing and rebirth.

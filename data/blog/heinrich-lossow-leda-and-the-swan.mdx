**Heinrich Lossow represents "Leda and the Swan" as they are fornicating in the grass.**

Leda is depicted naked, lying in the grass, clearly finding great pleasure in the sexual encounter. One of her hands is pulling the swan's beak to her boday, while her other outstretched arm has her fingers strained with sexual tension.

The flush vegetation looks like a cozy bed. Light pink and creamy colored flowers add to the feeling of lusciousness. Leda is depicted as a plentiful woman with her naked buttocks towards us. Her red hair, reddened cheeks and large pearls in her hair are adding to the sexual innuendo.

The background is dark with trees giving the impression of an intimate scene in a hidden clearing. An opening between the trees in the upper corner lets in light and gives the impression we the viewers are like peeking into this intimate scene.

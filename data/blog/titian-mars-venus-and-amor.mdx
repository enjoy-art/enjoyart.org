The union of the goddess of love with Mars, the god of war will result in the daughter Harmonia - a symbol of life -sustaining togetherness against opposing forces. Titian is noted as the author of the composition on a van Dycks. Whether the image of the original is started by the artist itself, which was then completed by a later hand, or a workshop review must remain open. However, the dramatic movement of the characters and the open brush stroke in parts of the incarnate are of remarkable picturesque quality.

"The marriage of Saint Ursula to Prince Conan" is part of the "Saint Auta altarpiece" which was commissioned by Eleanor, queen of Portugal, for the convent of madre de Deus in Lisbon. The richness of the clothes and jewellery, as well as the group of black musicians in the background, evoke the golden age of Lisbon. The faces all made quite young and beautiful shows an ideal of perfection.

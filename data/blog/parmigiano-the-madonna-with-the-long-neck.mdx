\"The Madonna with the Long Neck\" depicts an extra long Mary seated on a high pedestal in luxurious robes, holding an extremely long Jesus on her lap. Six angels crowded together on the Madonna's right adore the Christ-child. Parmigianino started the Mannerist figura serpentinata, where bodies are elongated and curved like serpents in an unatural way.

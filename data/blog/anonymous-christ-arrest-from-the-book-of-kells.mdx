The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript in Latin that was created in either Ireland or Scotland and that contains the four Gospels of the New Testament. Its many illustrations are remarkable in extravagance and complexity combining traditional Christian iconography and symbols with Celtic-influenced figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, Celtic knots, and interlacing patterns in vibrant colors. The palette of colors is exceptionally broad with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow, some of those pigments having been imported from the Mediterranean area, indicating clear lines of trade and communication.

* Title: Ceramic cup shaped as a naked woman
* Artist:  Anonymous (?-?)
* Date: c.0 to 800 AD
* Medium: Glazed ceramic cup
* Dimensions: 

In this pottery bowl the female form is shown with a disproportionately large vulva, associating her power to give life with the creative power of the earth- Pachamama, or Mother Earth. The bowl have been modeled so that the vulva forms the entrance and exit routes for liquids.

Symbolically, these bowls function as the vehicle for the flow of liquids into the body, as when the female body is inseminated, and also for the outward flow of fluids, as in childbirth. Also, it can be construed the symbolism is when a person drinks from this bowl, it is an act of oral sex performed upon the woman.

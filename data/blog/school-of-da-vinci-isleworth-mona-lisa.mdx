The Isleworth Mona Lisa is an early 16th-century oil on canvas painting depicting the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa though with the subject depicted as being a younger age.

There are many similarities between the two paintings- they both depict a dark-haired woman, Lisa Gherardini, who sits at an angle, has her hair covered by a transparent veil, has one hand one on top of her other wrist, and is surrounded by the landscape behind her. There are also differences- the model is noticeably younger; there are columns on each side; the background is less minutely worked on; this work was painted on canvas instead of wood. 

The painting got its unofficial name from Isleworth, West London, the place where the art collector Blaker exposed it to the public in 1913.

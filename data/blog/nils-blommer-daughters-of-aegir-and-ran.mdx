Nils Blommér portrayed a moonlit night in which the sea god Äegir’s daughters float on the waves surrounding the Water Sprite who is playing the harp. Aegir was married to Ran and they had nine daughters named for different waves. In the background the ruins of Stegeborg Castle. The moonlight, the ruins and the figures borrowed from folklore and from Norse mythology make the painting a very typical representative of north European art in the romantic era.

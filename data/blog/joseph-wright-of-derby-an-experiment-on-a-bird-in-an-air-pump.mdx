“An experiment on a bird in the air pump” departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for historical or religious scenes. The painting depicts a group of people observing a bird caught in a glass jar being progressively deprived of its air. A parrallel can be drawn between the innocent bird dying on the elevated platform and Jesus on the cross surrounded by mourners. Onlookers are displaying different reactions, with the central little girl showing discomfort but still observing the scene. The use of chiaroscuro increases the drama of the scene with the bright light as a symbol of truth. 

The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer to participate in the outcome- save the bird or conduct research ?

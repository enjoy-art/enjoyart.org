\"An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump\" depicts a group of people observing a scientific scene, an air pump experiment where a bird is deprived of air. The experiment is conducted in front of a varied group of onlookers who are displaying different reactions- for the grown-ups the scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird, but for the young girls in the center it is a loss of innocence moment where it is to be understood research and progress may require sacrifices. \n\nThe use of chiaroscuro increases the drama of the scene with the bright candlelight as a symbol of truth. The scene is represented in a reverential manner usually reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance, thus promoting science. The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer to participate in the outcome- should he save the bird and suspend the experiment or conduct the research and sacrifice the bird?

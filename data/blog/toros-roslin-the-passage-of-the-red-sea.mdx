Toros Roslin was the most prominent Armenian manuscript illuminator in the High Middle Ages. He introduced a wider range of narrative in his iconography based on his knowledge of western European art while continuing the conventions established by his predecessors. 

His style is characterized by a delicacy of color, an elegance of line, and an innovative iconography. The human figures in his illustrations are full of life and convey different emotional states.

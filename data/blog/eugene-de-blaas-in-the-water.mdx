We can all empathize with the experience of stepping into water and feeling its slight chill. However, the focus here is not on why the depicted woman is cautiously making her way into the sea, balancing herself with her arms and watching her step to avoid potential hazards like shells or weever fish, which can deliver venom if stepped on. 

Rather, the question arises- Why is this woman depicted nude when she is simply going to bathe in the sea?

"The Fall of Man" or "Adam and Eve" is a 1628-1629 painting by Rubens, now in the Prado in Madrid. It is a copy of the painting of the same subject by Titian, seen by Rubens during his 1628-1629 trip to Madrid for peace negotiations to end the Dutch Revolt. It reflects Raphael's influence on Titian and Jan Brueghel the Elder's influence on Rubens, who adds a parrot and changes Adam's posture, musculature, age and expression.

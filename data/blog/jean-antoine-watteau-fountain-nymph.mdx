Although more famous for the highly finished and elegant fêtes galantes that he painted, a genre which he invented and popularized, Watteau also painted a small number of more traditional subject pictures, of historical, allegorical and even erotic themes.  The Nymphe de Fontaine fuses together many of the best of all of the artist's essays in these differing areas, combining the grande manière of history painting with the gentle eroticism of the French rococo.\nThe Nymphe de Fontaine is a painting which also exhibits Watteau's skill in figure painting.  It depicts a young semi-nude nymph or goddess, holding an urn from which spills the source of the river of which she is tutelary deity.  The artist's absolute mastery of drawing is evident throughout the figure, in the beautifully achieved face of the nymph, and in her skillfully and elegantly articulated hands. The skin tones are rendered in pink and pearlescent tones which add an airy weight to the figure itself.  Equally beautiful is the landscape and sky beyond the goddess, which is painted in fluid and loose brushstrokes.  It is clearly from about the same time as the Ceres, and demonstrates many of the same qualities.

Egyptian frescos found in tombs often represented scenes from everyday life in the hope the deceased would enjoy those activities and find the painted objects and food in their afterlife. In this fresco, the deceased is the bigger subject hunting for wild birds in the marshes, probably an activity he enjoyed and is hoping to pursue in his afterlife.

![ Michelangelo - The Creation of Adam](/static/images/10607.jpg)

* Title: The Creation of Adam

The Creation of Adam is part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, a church approximately 41 meters long over 13 meters wide and 21 meters high with all the ceiling and walls covered with frescoes of biblical stories and representations of prophets and pontifs. Yet, this particular fresco stands out because it is painted in the exact center of the ceiling and also because of the space left between Adam and God contrasting with other frescoes which are more dense. \n\nIn this work, Michaelangelo conveys the energy of creation with the movement of God towards Adam and the determined finger of God about to touch the tentative finger of Adam whose eyes and body position also indicate energy is not yet fully flowing in his perfectly toned body.

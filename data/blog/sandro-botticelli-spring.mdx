Primevera is an elaborate painting commissioned either by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco to celebrate his wedding with Semiramide Appiano in 1482 or by Lorenzo il Magnifico, his uncle and the ruler of Florence. The painting depicts figures, all from classical mythology, in an orange grove with hundreds of plant and flower species. \nOne interpretation is that in the middle stands Venus, representing the bride Semiramide. She is wearing a blue dress and draped in red blue, with a halo formed by the blue sky between the trees. Her hair style resembles that for a Florentine wedding. Cupid, whose mother is Venus in the classical mythology, is flying over her head. \nOn the right of the painting, a blue winged figure representing Zephyrus, the west wind and bringer of light spring and early-summer breezes. Zephyrus kidnaps and possesses the nymph Chloris, whom he later marries, and transforms into a deity, Flora, goddess of flowers and Spring, bearer of life, here seen scattering roses on the ground and wearing a dress embroidered On the left of the paiting and the right of Venus, three Graces join hands in an elegant dance. The body shape of the Graces is meant to represent the ideal of Beauty with blonde, long hair, long faces and necks, a slim body with a bit of a belly. \nMore still to the left, Mercury might represent the future spouse, with the color red of his drapes reminding us of the bride. He holds the caduceus towards some thin gray clouds as to push them away and preserve the perfect Spring, maybe a symbol that as a husband he will ensure the future is clear.

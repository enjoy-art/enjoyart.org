"Frenzy of Exultations" or simply "Frenzy" is a renowned painting created in 1893 by Polish artist Władysław Podkowiński. It is recognized as a pioneering example of Symbolism in Polish art, emerging during a tumultuous period when Poland was partitioned among neighboring powers- Russia, Germany, and Austria.

The painting depicts a striking scene featuring a nude, redheaded woman astride a black, frenzied horse. The horse displays signs of agitation, with bared teeth, a protruding tongue, dilated nostrils, and froth emanating from its mouth. The woman grips the horse's neck tightly, her eyes shut in concentration, while her loose hair cascades and intermingles with the horse's mane, flowing upwards in a dynamic motion.

The color palette employed by Podkowiński is notably restrained, predominantly consisting of blacks, browns, and grays, juxtaposed with touches of white and yellow. The composition is characterized by a stark division between light and dark areas, with the upper left corner illuminated to draw attention to the woman and the horse's mouth, while the right side of the painting is engulfed in swirling darkness, revealing glimpses of the horse's hindquarters and tail.

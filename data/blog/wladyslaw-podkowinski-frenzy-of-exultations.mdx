Frenzy of Exultations (Szał uniesień), or better known as just Frenzy (Szał), is an 1893 painting by Polish artist Władysław Podkowiński and is credited as the most famous work in his output. It is considered the first work of Symbolism in Polish art, during a period when Poland was partitioned between its neighbours- Russia, Germany and Austria.\nThe painting shows a nude, redheaded woman riding a black, frenetic horse. The horse bares its teeth, its tongue hanging out. Its nostrils are dilated and foam runs from its mouth. The woman riding the horse tightly clasps its neck with her eyes closed, her loose hair fanning out and flowing upwards to mingle with the horse's mane.\n\nThe color range is quite narrow and is composed of blacks, browns and grays contrasting with the white and yellow. The image is divided into light and dark parts. The upper left corner is illuminated, directing attention to a clear figure of a woman and the horse's mouth. The right side of the painting shows whirled darkness in which the horse's hind and tail can be seen.

This type of iconography is not uncommon in 14th century Tuscany, although it has always posed an interesting problem for painters- how to show the breastfeeding of Christ by the Virgin Mary, the quintessential maternal gesture, without looking at her too much very undermining? Lippo Memmi solves this question by almost completely covering the breast. Through the hand of Christ it can hardly be seen.

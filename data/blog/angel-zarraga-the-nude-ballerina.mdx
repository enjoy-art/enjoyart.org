In 1909, Zàrraga sent two paintings to the Rome exhibition, the Allegory of Autumn (today in the National Museum of Art) and The Naked Dancer, acquired at the time by the Oran Museum and which today adorns the Blaisten collection. The Italian critic Rodolfo Panichi described the second painting as truly remarkable for the sobriety of the color and for the general intonation and vigor of the modeling. And he described it like this- a girl covered only by a black Spanish veil on her head, moves on a terrace with a light dance step, maintaining something composed and hieratic that gives the figure a feeling of chastity, despite the nudity. ...; she almost gives the impression of a grave Byzantine priestly figure. Her clothes and mantilla are placed in harmony of tone on the parapet of the terrace that opens onto the field; On the right, a woman, of admirable design and bearing, somewhere between indifferent and angry, sits waiting, nevertheless scrutinizing with the mocking air of an accustomed enjoyer, the effect produced on the spectator.\" And he characterized the execution of the work as \"voluntarily cold and punished.\" The incorporation, into an open and luminous landscape, of contrasting figures (clothed and naked, young and old), and the ritual character that it gives them, constitute a trademark of Zárraga's productions in these years. It is very possible This painting is related to La femme et le pantin, also signed in 1909 and with which it shared the same source of literary inspiration.

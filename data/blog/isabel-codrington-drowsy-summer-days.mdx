"Drowsy Summer Days" is a reclining nude painting by Isabel Codrington, created during the 1920s. This work is celebrated for its sensitive handling of light, texture, and composition, capturing the languid and intimate atmosphere of a summer day. Codrington's portrayal of the nude figure, with its attenuated torso and pale skin, is rendered with delicate transitions between flesh and fabric, evoking a sense of tranquility and timelessness.

Unlike many of her contemporaries, Codrington's approach to the nude is naturalistic and unidealized, focusing on the authenticity and humanity of her subject. Codrington's approach is also notable for its departure from the idealized nudes of male artists, offering a more authentic and unfiltered portrayal of the female form. However, from a male gaze perspective, the depicted subject was still chosen for her beauty and sensuality.

The 1920s were a time of artistic experimentation and cultural change, and Codrington's nude studies reflect the broader trends in European art, where artists sought to capture the **human form with honesty and sensitivity.

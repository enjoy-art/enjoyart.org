Pauwels Franck, known in Italy as Paolo Fiammingo and Paolo Franceschi, was a Flemish painter, who, after training in Antwerp, was active in Venice for most of his life. 

The painting reproduced here, "Mutual Love", was rapidly known through prints made by Agostino Carracci. It is possible that Carracci's reproduction was the inspiration for Matisse's "Joy of Life".

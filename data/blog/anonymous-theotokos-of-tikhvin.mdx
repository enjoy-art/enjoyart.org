The name of the painting \"Theotokos\" means God-bearer.  According to legend, it appeared on the shore of the Tikhvinka River in 1383; later at this place the monastery and town would be built. \n\nThe iconographic composition type is \"Hodegetria\". A Hodegetria, or Virgin Hodegetria, is an icon where Mary holds the child Jesus on her side while pointing to him as the source of salvation for humankind. Mary's head usually inclines towards the child, who raises his hand in a blessing gesture.

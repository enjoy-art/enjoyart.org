The name of the icon “Theotokos” means God-bearer. According to legend, the icon appeared on the shore of the Tikhvinka River in 1383; later at this place the monastery and town would be built. 

The iconographic composition is typical- Mary holds the child Jesus on her side while pointing to him as the source of salvation for humankind. Mary’s head is inclined towards the Jesus who raises his hand in a blessing gesture. Mary is fully covered in a dark cloak with three stars forming a triangle, symbolyzing the Holy Trinity.

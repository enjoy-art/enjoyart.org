Composition X marks Van Doesburg's break with the symbolism of his early days and his switch to a form of abstraction that was still inspired by reality.\n\nPainted by Theo Van Doesburg one year after the formation of the De Stijl group, of which he was one of the founders, Composition X is thought to have been inspired by a portrait of the artist' s second wife, Lena Milius. Unlike the first very colourful studies, the final painting presents only black, white and grey surfaces, framed by black lines, after the fashion of a stained glass window.

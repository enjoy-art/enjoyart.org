As with many of Heward’s paintings, despite the title, this work portrays a woman rather than a girl. In Heward’s painting of a young black girl, Clytie, 1938, the subject wears a pink dress and white gloves. Yet in most of her paintings of black women, Heward depicts her subjects nude or semi-naked, as in Dark Girl, 1935, and Negress with Sunflowers, 1936. The subject in Girl in the Window, however, wears a cardigan, and her stomach is covered with a skirt or blanket. But she wears no blouse under the sweater, so her breasts are partially visible. This is not an explicitly erotic painting, but by making the choice to reveal the woman’s breasts, Heward presents her as vulnerable and accessible to the viewer’s gaze, whether the viewer is male or female, and the sitter may well have been perceived as a sexual object. This speaks to the power imbalance between the white artist and the black sitter. As with most of Heward’s paintings of black women, the identity of the woman in Girl in the Window is unknown, as is how Heward met her.2

Titian's \"Rape of Europa\" shows Zeus, metamorphosized in a white bull, swimming away to the island of Crete with kidnaped princess Europa on his back. In the background, her handmaiden are desperate of having let the princess go. Eros, who had shot an arrow causing Zeus to be infatuated with Europa, is seen flying and waving at Europa.\n\nThe interest in colors, mythological themes and full-bodied characters are typical of Titian's  lifelong style. However, the work on tones of colors instead of vivid ones and the looseness of his brushwork giving a sense of movement characterize his later works and mark a first in the history of Western painting, which will influence Rubens, Poussin, and later Romanticism.

In Massimo Stanzione's "Susanna and the Elders," the artist portrays a distressed Susanna as she struggles to evade a sexual assault. This depiction from the Old Testament illustrates two elderly village judges scheming to ambush Susanna while she bathes in her garden. Should she resist their advances, they threaten to accuse her of adultery, a crime punishable by death. Despite her unwavering trust in God, Susanna refuses their advances and ultimately receives divine vindication. The young prophet Daniel, inspired by God, recognizes her innocence and exposes the true perpetrators.



With keen psychological insight, Stanzione directs the narrative focus towards the monumental figures, emphasizing their body language, facial expressions, and gestures. Susanna's pristine form stands in stark contrast to the weathered features and coarse clothing of the elders, underscoring her innocence and vulnerability. Despite her nudity symbolizing innocence and defenselessness, it is paradoxically presented to the viewer.

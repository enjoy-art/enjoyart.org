The Mystical Nativity or Adoration in the Forest was painted as the altarpiece for the Magi Chapel in the new Palazzo Medici in Florence. It is a highly individual depiction of the familiar scene of the Nativity of Jesus in art, placed in a mountainous forest setting, with debris from woodcutting all around, rather than the familiar stable in Bethlehem, and with the usual figures and animals around the mother and child replaced by others. The setting, finesse of the faces and technique of \"drapé\" are precursors of Primavera of Botticelli who his pupil.

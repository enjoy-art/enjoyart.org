It depicts a naked Venus, the Roman goddess of love, sleeping under trees accompanied at her feet by her son Cupid with his bow and arrow. A putto sits at her side clutching more arrows. The brightly painted body of Venus in the foreground is set against a darkly painted rural background, in which two men are gazing lustfully at her from behind a tree and a pair of lovers are in the middleground.

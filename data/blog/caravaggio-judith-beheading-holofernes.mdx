“Judith beheading Holofernes” is a gripping biblical scene from the Book of Judith, where Judith, a beautiful widow, seduces and decapitates the Assyrian general Holofernes to save her city from siege.

There is great emotional intensity in Caravaggio’s painting- Judith looks innocent and repulsed by what she is doing, yet she is going through her definitive business. Holofernes is represented as a big, muscular and imposing figure and lies defenseless, his fate sealed by Judith’s hand.

The contrast between Judith’s delicate beauty, accentuated by her white shirt and pale face, and the gruesome act she performs adds layers of complexity to the narrative, inviting viewers to contemplate themes of power, justice, and female agency.

lt was this painting inaugurating a new period that Kandinsky chose to adorn the dining room of his Bauhaus apartment in Dessau.\nWassily Kandinsky turned increasingly toward geometrical composition while he started to teach at the Bauhaus, a stimulating environment for the artist. Returning faithfully to a watercolour he made in 1922 (Paris, Mnam), the artist delivers up one of his most suprematist works here. Under the influence of centrifugai forces, the forms with sharp contours and acute angles are shattered into pieces along diagonal lines. Only the violet form curving toward the centre seems ta resist this movement.

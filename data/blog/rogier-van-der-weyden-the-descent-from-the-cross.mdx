“The Descent from the Cross” by Rogier van der Weyden was a monumental artwork commisssioned by the Leuven guild of archers for their church, The Kapel van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ginder-buiten or Chapel of Our Lady Without the Walls. The commission coming at the end of his apprenticeship with Robert Campin, van der Weyden was very much influenced by his master but at the same time seized the opportunity to make a name for himself.

The influence from his master is clear-  realistic facial features, vivid flat colours, very minute details. Yet the composition is Rogier van der Weyden’s own- the cross shape panel; many people crammed together in such a tight place doing different things in different layers; Mary swooning at the foot of the cross in a parrallel to Jesus’ dead body being brought down.

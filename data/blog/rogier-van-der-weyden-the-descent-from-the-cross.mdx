The work has been often copied and is extremely influential. He did it shortly after completing his apprenticeship with Robert Campin and shows his influence- realistic facial features and vivid primary colours, mostly reds, whites and blues. Note the depth of the painting, how much is going on in such a tight space and how strong emotions are.

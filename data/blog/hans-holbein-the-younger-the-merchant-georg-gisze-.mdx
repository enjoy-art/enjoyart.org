Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait \"The Merchant Georg Gisze\" was one of a series of portraits of wealthy Hanseatic merchants (a powerful North European guild) made in the 1530s in London. This portrait signaled the increasing importance of the merchant class in Northern Europe, where rich bourgeoisie became the primary subjects and clients of portraits.\n\nThe portrait showed the wealth of the merchant and included many very finely painted details denoting how successful the merchant was and also demonstrating how talented the painter was- the rich fabrics of the clothes, the pot with coins, the written invoices, the globe indicating worldwide reach, etc.

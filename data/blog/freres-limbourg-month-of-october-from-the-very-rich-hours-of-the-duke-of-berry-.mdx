The peasant scene in the foreground depicts plowing the field to make furrows and sowing seeds. Magpies and crows are pecking at the freshly sown seeds. In the background of the field, a scarecrow shaped like an archer and stretched wires. The scene includes the Louvre palace, and figures conversing on the riverbank of the river Seine.

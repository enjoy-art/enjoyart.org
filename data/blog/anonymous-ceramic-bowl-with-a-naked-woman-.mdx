Remarkable glazed cut with gray lead pigmentation. It has in the upper part on its outer part a frieze composed of three parallel lines interspersed with interlaced patterns punctuated by dots in their middle. The cup houses in its center a female figure in high relief. She is shown naked, lying on her back with her legs bent, sex signified by a hole telling us that she is about to give birth. The face is part of a large rectangle and has scarifications or elaborate facial paintings. The eagle-beaked nosed nose receives dilated nostrils and takes place above a fine rectangular mouth. The hairstyle, simple, frames the face and covers the entire forehead. Eyes whose shape refers to the general aesthetic of the face has deep orbits punctuated by a hole, giving depth to the eyes. The chest is small and the prominent breasts are dotted. The right hand is positioned under the right breast while the other is placed on the abdomen, as if to feel the presence of the unborn child. She is adorned with a large necklace and bracelets on each wrist.

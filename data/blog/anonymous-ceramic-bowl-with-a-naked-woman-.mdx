![ Anonymous - Ceramic bowl with a naked woman ](/static/images/10107.jpg)

* Title: Ceramic bowl with a naked woman 
* Artist:  Anonymous (?-?)
* Date: c.600 BCE
* Medium: Glazed ceramic bowl
* Dimensions: 21 cm diameter

The glazed bowl is decorated with a frieze of parallel lines and dots on its upper, outer part. The cup houses in its center a female figure in high relief. She is shown naked, lying on her back with her legs bent, one hand holding her lower belly which is big, and her sex signified by a hole telling us that she is giving birth. Her face is elaborately decorated, is it paint or are those scarifications?

A classic story of the gods- the wedding of the sea goddess Thetis and the human Peleus. All the gods were invited except Eris, goddess of discord. In revenge, she threw (top left) a golden (twist) apple 'for the fairest' among the goddesses present. The shepherd Paris was then asked to choose (top right). Hera promises him wealth, Athena offers him wisdom and Aphrodite promises him the most beautiful woman in the world- Helen of Sparta. Paris' choice of Aphrodite indirectly led to the Trojan War. The painting was intended as a warning against discord. The city of Haarlem had the work made for the guesthouse of the governors, the Prinsenhof.\nThe Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.\n\nIn this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory.

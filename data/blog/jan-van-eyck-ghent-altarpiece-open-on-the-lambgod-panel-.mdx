“The Ghent Altarpiece” or “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb” was created by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck. It is considered a founding painting of the Northern Renaissance. The altarpiece consists of a central panel and a series of hinged wings that can be opened and closed. The central panel depicts the Mystic Lamb, a symbol of Christ’s sacrifice and redemption, standing on an altar surrounded by a choir of angels. The angels are playing various musical instruments, and in the background is a heavenly landscape with a city and a river. The wings of the altarpiece are painted with scenes from the Old and New Testaments, as well as depictions of saints and donors. A remarkable aspect is the attention to detail, such as the intricate patterns on the clothing of the figures, the flections in their eyes, and the subtle variations of light and shadow.

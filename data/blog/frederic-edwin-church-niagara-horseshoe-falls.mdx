Church's painting is of Horseshoe Falls, the largest and most iconic of Niagara's three waterfalls. With a width of 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in), it is more than twice as wide as it is high. The canvas's unusual proportions allowed him to paint a panoramic view from the Canadian side of the falls; the composition leads the eye laterally. The vantage point was dramatic and unique, leaving behind the \"canonical banality\" of many other paintings before it,[6] the merely picturesque, and immersing the viewer directly in the scene, as if airborne or even in the water. The lack of a repoussoir aids this effect. Before the advent of modern photography, which made such images common, this was a revelation.[3]\n\nNiagara is highly naturalistic, more so than Church's previous The Andes of Ecuador (1855), and shows the influence of John Ruskin's aesthetics on Church.

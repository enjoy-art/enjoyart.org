* Title: Cylix of Apollo
* Artist:  Anonymous (-)
* Date: 480 BCE
* Medium: Painting on Ceramic
* Dimensions: 
* Location: Archaeological Museum, Delphi, Greece

This painting is found at the bottom of a cylix, a drinking cup with a broad, shallow bowl and a handle on either side. Apollo is wearing a laurel wreath, is seating on a lion-pawed diphros, is holding a kithara and is pouring a libation with his right hand. Facing him is a black crow/raven bird which may allude to his love affair with Coronis because crow and Coronis share the same root and/or refer to prediction of the future as it is a mantic bird.

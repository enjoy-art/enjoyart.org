![ Anonymous - Cylix of Apollo](/static/images/10141.jpg)

* Title: Cylix of Apollo
* Artist:  Anonymous (-)
* Date: c.480 BCE
* Medium: Painting on Ceramic
* Dimensions: 17,8 cm diameter
* Location: Archaeological Museum, Delphi, Greece

This Greek painting is found at the bottom of a cylix, a drinking cup with a broad, shallow bowl and a handle on either side. Apollo is wearing a laurel wreath, is seating on a lion-pawed diphros, is holding a kithara (a seven-stringed lyre, whose sound-box is made of a turtle-shell), and is pouring a libation with his right hand. Facing him is a black crow which may allude to his love affair with Coronis because the word “crow” shares the same root and/or refer to prediction of the future as it is a mantic bird.

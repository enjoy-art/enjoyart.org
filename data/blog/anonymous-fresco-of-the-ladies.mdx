The women are wearing coloured Minoan robes with kilts and jackets which leaves the breasts exposed in typical Minoan fashion. The women each wear earrings and a necklace and they both have long hair and wear makeup. All of these details suggest that these were women of high status involved in some sort of religious activity or festival. The elaborate dresses, jewellery and hairstyles show that this lady in the picture is an adult according to the hair theory. It also represents the beauty of women in the Minoan culture as they seem to have make up on.

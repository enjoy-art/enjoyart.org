![ Anonymous - Fresco of the Ladies](/static/images/10208.jpg)

* Title: Fresco of the Ladies
* Artist:  Anonymous (-)
* Date: c.1600 BCE
* Medium: Fresco
* Dimensions: 

This part of "The fresco of the ladies" shows a woman wearing a colored Minoan dress and jacket which leaves the breasts exposed in typical Minoan fashion. The woman wears earrings, long hair made into a braid, and makeup on the lips and the cheeks. All of these details suggest that she is of high status and is an adult. She is bending forward and is barefoot which might suggest some sort of dance or religious activity.

Were her breasts that voluminous or did the artist decide to emphacize their size for some reason?

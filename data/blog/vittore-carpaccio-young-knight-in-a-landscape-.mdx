"Young Knight in a Landscape" is an oil on canvas painting which is the earliest known full-length portrait in Western painting. The painting shows a young knight in a very rich and busy landscape with many species of birds, of mammals, of flowers and trees.

This might be a memorial portrait of a dead person as indicated by many clues - the scroll on the bottom left of the painting "malo mori quam foedari" which means "I prefer to die rather than to incur dishonour"; the heron caught in the sky by a hawk ; the vulture scavening on the right.

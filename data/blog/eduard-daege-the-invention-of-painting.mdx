In Book XXX of the Historia naturalis, Pliny the Elder tells of the departure of Butades, the daughter of the Corinthian potter, from her lover before a journey. After she has written the outline of his shadow on the wall, her father will make a clay relief. This is the foundation of first the art of drawing, then that of sculpture. This myth was familiar to German artists from Joachim von Sandrart's \"Teutscher Academie\" (1675), and to the reading public from writings by Herder and Lessing, among others. He accommodated the classicist theory of art, which insisted on deriving painting from line (rather than colour) – a view that is also shared by Daege's sharply defined, crystal-clear style of painting, which is entirely in tune with local colours.\nSince 1790, the theme has appeared several times in Berlin, for example by Bernhard Rode, Franz Ludwig Catel, Johann Gottfried Schadow and Johann Erdmann Hummel. Usually, the process is depicted in the interior- Pliny explicitly mentions a lamp. Daege places him outdoors, at a fountain, with the sun as a source of light. However, this corresponds to other interpretations of the legend, according to which, for example, a shepherd traces his own shadow on the ground with his staff. In Schinkel's design (1830) for the fresco \"Human Life\" in the lobby of the museum, the shepherd traces the shadow of a girl in the open air. However, the arrangement of the group of figures corresponds even more closely to a composition by Joseph-Benoît Suvée (1791, Groeningemuseum, Bruges), which had been circulated as a copper engraving. In 1840 Daege modified his composition for the main motif of an allegorical album title page (pencil, Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin).

The Dutch painter and \"Master of the Death of the Virgin\" Joos van Cleve created the work around 1530, probably at the court of the French King Francis I (1494-1547). He had appointed him to his court in the same year. The lady depicted was probably a mistress. Her upper body is bare and only her back and right arm are covered by a robe. She looks out of the picture head-on, although her upper body is turned slightly to the left. The lady's skin is elegantly pale. She wears a necklace, earrings and bracelet as well as jewelry in her hair. The background is kept dark. Two draped green curtains frame the sitter.\n\nThe semi-nude of a young woman has already given rise to some discussions. On the one hand, the painting was incorrectly traded as a copy of Joos van Cleve until 2007. On the other hand, the portrait was compared to Leonardo da Vinci's (1452-1519) \"Mona Lisa\". The posture and facial features of the mistress painted by Cleve are vaguely reminiscent of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\". It is therefore assumed in art history that Cleve saw the \"Mona Lisa\" at the French court itself or one of the numerous contemporary copies.

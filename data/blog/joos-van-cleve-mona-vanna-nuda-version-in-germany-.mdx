The Dutch painter Joos van Cleve created the work "Mona Vanna Nuda" around 1530, probably at the court of the French King Francis I (1494-1547) and probably inspired by the Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci which then belonged to the King of France.

The lady's upper body is bare and only her back and right arm are covered by a robe. She looks out of the picture head-on, although her upper body is turned slightly to the left. Her hands are confidently resting on a column in front of her, one hand over the other wrist as with the "Mona Lisa". The lady's skin is elegantly pale and her smile is alluring. She wears a necklace, earrings and bracelet as well as jewelry in her hair. The background is kept dark with two draped dark-green curtains framing her.

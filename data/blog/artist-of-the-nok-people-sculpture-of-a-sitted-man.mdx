This terracotta statue of a man sitting is typical of Nok statues. The head commands attention with its strikingly oversized proportions compared to the supporting body, yet it boasts intricate details and a commanding presence. A tidy projection from the chin indicates the portrayal of a beard, while necklaces encircle the neck, drawing focus to the face.

The Nok civilization, initially unearthed in 1928 in central Nigeria, has since been subject to extensive archaeological study, revealing them as one of West Africa's earliest complex societies. Flourishing from around 900 BC to approximately 200 AD, the Nok boasted an advanced society, featuring a sophisticated legal system and pioneering the creation of life-sized terracotta in the Sub-Sahara region. Excavations have unveiled a wealth of artifacts, including stone tools, rock paintings, and iron implements like formidable spearheads, bracelets, and small knives.

Dating back to at least 500 BC, the Nok figures typically portray individuals with disproportionately large, elongated heads, almond-shaped eyes, and parted lips. Despite these unconventional characteristics, the statues exhibit accurate proportions between head, body, and feet.

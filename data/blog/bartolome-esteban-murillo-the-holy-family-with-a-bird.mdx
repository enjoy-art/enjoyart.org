\"The Holy Family with a Little Bird\" is a painting of Mary, Joseph and Jesus together in their home. Jesus is holding a little bird and standing in front of a little white puppy who seems to want to go for the bird. \n\nThe painting is very much a domestic scene, exalting home, family life filled with tenderness- Mary and Joseph are looking at their child Jesus; Jesus is leaning on his dad; Mary is winding thread; Joseph has wrinkles on his forehead as if worried for his son; the puppy in the foreground accentuates this feeling of loving, nuclear family.

Egon Schiele created Akt mit roten Strumpfbander in 1911, and this picture shows the changes in his aesthetic style and in his relationships with women that characterised this fulcrum period in his brief career. Akt mit roten Strumpfbander shows a women from the knees upwards; her arms have been ignored. Instead, the rose tints of her body dominate the composition, as does her face, which grounds the viewer in a penetrating gaze. The intense dark mop of her hair is thrust into bold relief by the light wash that has been placed, like a halo, around her head. This also accentuates the pulsing flickers of red that run through Schiele's depiction of her body, giving a visceral sense of flesh, blood and heat. Schiele's sense of colour is further augmented by the brown-red outlines to either side of the subject's body, which meander and flow with incredible assurance, adding to the resonances which are only augmented by the polychrome patchwork of material upon which she is lying. Akt mit roten Strumpfbander was formerly in the collection of Samuel G. Gallu, a playwright who was also a film and television producer and who owned a group of works by artists such as Schiele and Otto Dix.

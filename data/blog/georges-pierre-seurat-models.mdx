In this scene set inside the artist's studio, Seurat depicts models posing in front of A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884 (1884–86; Art Institute of Chicago), his most famous pointillist painting. Informed by scientific theories of light, color, and optics, pointillism was dismissed by many critics at the time for being too cold and methodical—a style that could never be applied to noble subjects like the nude. Here, Seurat seems to offer his response, presenting life-size bodies from multiple angles.\nModels, also known as The Three Models and Les Poseuses, is a work by Georges Seurat, painted between 1886 and 1888 and held by the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. Models was exhibited at the fourth Salon des Indépendants in spring of 1888.\nThe piece, the third of Seurat's six major works, is a response to critics who deemed Seurat's technique inferior for being cold and unable to represent life.[2] As a response, the artist offered a nude depiction of the same model in three different poses. In the left background is part of Seurat's 1884-1886 painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\nModels is considered distinctive because of its pointillist technique and the political implications of its depiction of the nude female body.

The \"Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife\" is a full-length double portrait painting of the Italian merchant and his wife, presumably in their home at the Flemish city of Bruges. It is the oldest famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera.  \n\nIn the typical Dutch style, this painting contains an incredible mastery of form, brushwork and color to create intense details.\nIt is considered a masterpiece because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror.\n\nVan Eyck used the technique of applying many layers to create an intensity of tone and colour. The glowing colors also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth of Arnolfini's world. The illusionism of the painting was remarkable for its time, in part for the rendering of detail, but particularly for the use of light to evoke space in an interior.

The “Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife” is a full-length double portrait painting of the Italian merchant and his pregnant wife, presumably in their home at the Flemish city of Bruges. It is remarkable in many ways- it is a commission by a merchant and not a ruler; the paint used is oil-based instead of tempera; the mastery of form, brushwork and color, particularly in the reflexion of the scene in the convex mirror.

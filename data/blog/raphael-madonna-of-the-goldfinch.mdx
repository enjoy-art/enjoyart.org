Raphael arranged the three figures - Mary, Christ and the young John the Baptist - to form an almost regular triangle. The Madonna is shown young and beautiful. She is clothed in red (the passion of Christ) and blue (used to signify the Church). John, who can be recognized by his camel hair skirt with a leather belt, holds a goldfinch in his hand, and Christ is reaching out to touch it. The bird represents Christ's crucifixion. The painting exudes maternal love with Mary's hand around John, her soft eyes on him and Jesus' foot on hers as children can do.\nIn this painting Raphael demonstrates the qualities of perfection he is admired for and is unequaled- balanced composition, serenity of the atmosphere, harmony of colors and expressions, beauty of the characters.

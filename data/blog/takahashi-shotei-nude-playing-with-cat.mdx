While Shotei was primarily a landscape artist, and a prolific one at that, when he did try his hand at bijin subjects the results were surprising. The three nudes which Shotei produced between 1927 and 1931 with the publisher Fusui Gabo are among the most provocative and desirable bijin shin-hanga; they are also perhaps the most rare as the Fusui Gabo headquarters was destroyed (including their inventory of blocks and prints) during World War II.

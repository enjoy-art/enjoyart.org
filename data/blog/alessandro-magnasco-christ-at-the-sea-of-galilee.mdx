In \"Christ at the Sea of Galilee\", Magnasco depicted a scene from the episode where Christ's disciples are on a boat caught in a terrible storm. Jesus walked to them on the water to reassure them and invited Peter to join him. Peter started walking on water too until he started doubting at which point he started sinking. Magnasco captured that moment where Jesus was half-turned around, encouraging a sinking Peter to trust and believe.\nMagnascoâ€™s style is novel- the eerie, stormy sea is painted with a very loose, swirling, passionate brushwork. Romanticism can be foreseen in the movement of the sea and of the trees in the storm (see Turner) and in the depiction of the subjects so small compared to the elements and showing so much expression.

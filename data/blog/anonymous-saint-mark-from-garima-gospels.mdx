The Garima Gospels are two ancient Gospel Books believed to be the earliest surviving complete illuminated Christian manuscript. They are preserved in an isolated monastery in the Ethopian Tigray region set among 2000 meter-high mountains. \n\nAccording to legend, the manuscripts were brought to Ethiopia from Constantinople by Abba Garima in the year 494 AD, which is consistent with carbon-dating.

\"Joseph the Carpenter\" depicts a young Jesus with Saint Joseph, his earthly father, in à style \"à la chandelle\" or tenebrist where a single, strong light source is a central element, surrounded by cast shadows. \n\nThis painting humanizes very much the character of Jesus who has no aureola, is not source of the light but lit by the candle, is patienty observing his dad working holding the candle to help him see and the two share a moment looking at each other. Maybe the look has to do with the cross-like shape of the tool that Joseph is using, a foreshadowing of the crucifixion.

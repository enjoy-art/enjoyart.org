In this painting of El Greco, "The Annunciation", El Greco chooses to create a feeling of verticality and movement to Paradise from the start by choosing a special format twice as high as wide. El Greco was a big admirer of Corregio and also of Pamiggiano and both artists' work can be traced as influence in El Greco's "Annunciation"- the light/dark of Corregio (the dove representing the Holy Spirit is the source of light) and the elongated figures and sharp colors of Parmiggiano.

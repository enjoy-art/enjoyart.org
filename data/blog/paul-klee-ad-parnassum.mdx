The painting "Ad Parnassum" features a series of geometric shapes and symbols arranged in a seemingly chaotic yet harmonious manner. The title "Ad Parnassum" refers to Mount Parnassus, a symbol of artistic inspiration and creativity in Greek mythology, further emphasizing the painting's connection to the world of art and aesthetics.

Klee's use of color, symbols, lines and geometric forms in "Ad Parnassum" creates a sense of movement, musicality and visual harmony, inviting viewers to explore the intricate layers of meaning within the work. 

Klee had visited Egypt so the pyramidical shape is probably an Egyptian pyramid, one of the world's wonders, from a civilization with great symbolism and mysteries.

Overall, "Ad Parnassum" is a captivating and thought-provoking work that showcases Klee's unique artistic vision and his ability to convey complex ideas through abstract forms and symbols.

Von Stuck frequently depicted a mythological world populated with nymphs and centaurs, baccantes and fauns. It was a playful world with distinctly comic and erotic undertones. The present work depicts a beautiful nymph, reclining naked in a verdant landscape, listening to a garlanded youth playing a pipe. They are at once at ease with each other and with the countryside around them. It is a scene of harmony and sensual abandonment.

James Deegan says this is “an excellent example of a Pre-Raphaelite painting – unusually by a woman!  The legend of Medea, who poisoned her children as a revenge on her philandering husband Jason, has a modern and ancient interpretation”\nEvelyn de Morgan (1855-1919) specialized in literary subjects, in a style owing much to the Pre-Raphaelites and to such Renaissance artists as Botticelli (she and her husband spent each winter in Italy for the sake of his health).  At the end of her career she painted several allegories relating to the First World War, exhibiting them to raise money for the Red Cross.\nEvelyn de Morgan, ‘Medea’, oil on canvas, 148 x 88cm, Williamson Art Gallery, purchased 1927.\nEvelyn De Morgan (née Pickering) was wife of the potter William De Morgan and a follower of Edward Burne-Jones, but a fine painter and draughtswoman in her own right. The painting shows the sorceress Medea plotting to tempt back Jason.

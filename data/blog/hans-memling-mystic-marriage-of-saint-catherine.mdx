The “Mystic Marriage of St Catherine” represents a dream Catherine of Alexandria is said to have had in which she is married to Jesus in presence of Mary and from which she woke up with a ring on her finger. Emperor Maxentius tortured Catherine and, when she proclaimed herself married to Christ, cut off her head. The painting is characteristic of Memling’s serene style, exhibiting visual harmony in its structure and color. The painting reflects techniques and synthesizes elements seen in the works of Van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who was Memling’s master. And in a typcial Flemish style of the time, the figures are made slim and young and the women beautiful, prude and pure.

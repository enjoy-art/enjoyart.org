The “Armada portrait of Elizabeth I of England” is the name of any of three surviving versions of an allegorical panel painting depicting the Tudor queen surrounded by symbols of royal majesty against a backdrop representing the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. 

English art in this period was isolated from trends in Catholic Italy and France and owed more to manuscript illumination and heraldic codes than to Renaissance techniques, nor much to Baroque except the extremely rich clothes and very elongated arms and hands.

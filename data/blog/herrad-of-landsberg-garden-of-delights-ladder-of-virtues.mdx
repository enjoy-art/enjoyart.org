“Hortus deliciarum” or “Garden of delights” is a medieval manuscript compiled by Herrad of Landsberg, abbess of Mont Sainte-Odile Abbey in France. It was an illuminated encyclopedia, begun in 1167 as a pedagogical tool for young novices at the convent. It is the first known encyclopedia that was evidently written by a woman. It was finished in 1185, and was one of the most celebrated illuminated manuscripts of the period. Herrad of Landsberg’s colorful, symbolic and figurative style was influential in how religious messages would be conveyed.

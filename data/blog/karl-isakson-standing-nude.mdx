The Bornholm painters influenced the entire Danish art scene. They were the first in Denmark to introduce the new modern European tendencies in painting.\n\nThey particularly cultivated the new French art and its experiments with color, abstraction, and cubism.\n\nEspecially CÃ©zanne, Matisse and Picasso's new painting techniques made a great impact on the Danish artists.\n\nTo think of a picture as an independent reality is an idea that originated in France. The most important feature was the coloristic and technically liberated way of painting, which gave lines, surfaces and colors their own language and musicality.\n\nThus, the landscape became the preferred motif as it was a good starting point for experimenting with colors.\n

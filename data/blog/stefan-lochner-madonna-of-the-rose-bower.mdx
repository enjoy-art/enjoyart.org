In \"Madonna of the Rose Bower\", the Virgin is seated in a rose garden, symbolizing the heavenly Eden, and presented as Queen of Heaven with many signs of her virginity- the red and white roses, her crown and medallion, the purity of her traits, her looking down with modesty. Christ holds an apple, a symbol to signify him as the New Adam. \n\nThe painting is Cologne's most famous painting, has been reproduced very many times and generations of Christian Germans have had special feelings for this representation of the \"Muttergottes\" (Mother of God).

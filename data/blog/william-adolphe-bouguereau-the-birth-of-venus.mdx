// Tiepolo\nThe subject matter, as well as the composition, resembles a previous rendition of this subject, Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, as well as Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea.\nAt the center of the painting, Venus stands nude on a scallop shell[1] being pulled by a dolphin, one of her symbols. Fifteen putti, including Cupid and his lover Psyche, and several nymphs and centaurs have gathered to witness Venus' arrival. Most of the figures are gazing at her, and two of the centaurs are blowing into conch and Triton shells, signaling her arrival.\n\nVenus is considered to be the embodiment of feminine beauty and form, and these traits are shown in the painting.[1] Her head is tilted to one side, and her facial expression reflects that she is calm and comfortable with her nudity. She raises her arms,[2] arranging her thigh-length, brown hair, swaying elegantly in an \"S\" curve contrapposto, emphasizing the curves of her body.[3]

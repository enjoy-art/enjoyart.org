The undressed girl sits to the right, a white cloth placed over her lap, the folds of which she pulls up with her left hand while she covers her breast with her right. The graceful but shy gaze directed upwards to the left, as if observing people unexpectedly approaching. The finely painted flesh, reproduced in sfumato, stands out effectively illuminated against the dark green foliage background and a mighty oak trunk. The black, shiny hair parted in the middle and brought back. The depiction undoubtedly reveals the theme of Susanna in the bath, with the moment before the two old people approach being depicted here. A psychologizing moment typical of 19th century painting- romanticism

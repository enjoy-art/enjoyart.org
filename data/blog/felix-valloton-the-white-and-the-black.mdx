The painting "The white and the black" represents a nude white woman asleep on a bed with a fully dressed black woman sitting by her side smoking a cigarette. 

Some critics have noted the contrast between Suzanne Vallotton's painting and Manet’s "Olympia"- Olympia awake and controlling the viewer with her gaze versus Suzanne's model asleep; the black maid of Olympia in the back holding deferently a bouqet versus the maid being here in the front of stage smoking a cigarette; the elaborate wall fabric and bedding of Olympia's room versus the plain green wall and plain white sheets in this case.The painting "The white and the black" represents a nude white woman asleep on a bed with a fully dressed black woman sitting by her side smoking a cigarette.

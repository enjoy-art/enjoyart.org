It is difficult to associate the pungent humour of his large reprise of Manet’s Olympia – in which the black maid at the back now appears front of stage (Vallotton’s blocking is superb) smoking a sardonic cigarette – with the haunting beauty of his empty landscapes.\n\nAnd it is nearly impossible to believe that the same artist could have produced the long sequence of shadowy interiors that look forward to Alfred Hitchcock and Edward Hopper, as well as the even longer series of terrible female nudes, lumpen, cold and crude.

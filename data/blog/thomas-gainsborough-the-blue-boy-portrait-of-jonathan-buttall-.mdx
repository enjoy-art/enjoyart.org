The “blue boy” is a striking portrait notably because of contrasts between the boy (intense blue clothes and pale and still face) and the background (darker and tumultuous).  The style reminds us of Van Dyck’s portraits (see "Charles I at the hunt", page 96). 

The boy’s confident and satisfied look makes the viewer think he has the whole world in his hands.

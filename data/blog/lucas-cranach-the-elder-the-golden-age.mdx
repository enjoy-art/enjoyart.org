The panel shows the Garden of Paradise in which naked figures of both sexes while away the time. On the left a group dance around an apple tree, in the centre one pair bathes and another rests, while on the right a further pair eats grapes. In additon to the rich vegetation the peaceful coexistence gives the impression of paradise. The garden isolated from the outside world by a wall at the back.

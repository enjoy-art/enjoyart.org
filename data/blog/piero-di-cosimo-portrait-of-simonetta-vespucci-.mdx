In this portrait, Simonetta is a bare-breasted, pure, young woman with a rich, married-woman's hairstyle, wearing a gold necklace with a snake twining it and going for its own tail (a symbol of the circle of life or of eternal life or of wisdom). In the background on the left an arid landscape symbolizing death.

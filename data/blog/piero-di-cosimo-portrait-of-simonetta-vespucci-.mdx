In this portrait executed after her death, Simonetta is a bare-breasted, pure, young woman with a married-womanâ€™s hairdo. Simonetta died when 23, hence the symbols- the gold necklace with a snake twining it and going for its own tail (a symbol of the circle of life or of eternal life), the dark cloud and her turned towards a dead tree.

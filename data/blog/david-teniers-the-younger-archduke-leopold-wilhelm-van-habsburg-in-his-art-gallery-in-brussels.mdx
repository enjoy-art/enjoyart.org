The painting "The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his painting gallery in Brussels" shows the Archduke, who served as Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, as a collector with friends admiring a set of paintings. 

The artist himself is standing at a table inspecting engravings. The paintings are arranged in rows on rear walls, with more visible through a central doorway, and a set that are positioned in the foreground leaning against chairs for inspection.

This painting is one of a set that David Teniers the Younger prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his Theatrum Pictorium, considered the "first illustrated art catalog", in Antwerp in 1659.

The Venetian painter Titian and his workshop made at least six versions of the same composition showing Danaë and the shower of gold. The scene is based on the mythological princess Danaë. She was isolated in a bronze tower following a prophecy that her firstborn would eventually kill her father. Although aware of the consequences, Danaë was seduced and became pregnant by Zeus who, inflamed by lust, descended from Mount Olympus to seduce her in the form of a shower of gold.

Titian made at least six versions of the paintings with differences between each; but all composition included a voluptuous figure of Danaë, with legs half spread to receive Zeus' gold.

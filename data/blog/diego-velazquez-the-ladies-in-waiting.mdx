\"Las Meninas\" depicts a group of people in a large, ornately decorated room of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. At the center of the composition is the Infanta Margarita Teresa, surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting and other members of the Spanish Court. The artist Velázquez is on the side, seen painting a very tall painting. In the mirror at the back of the room, we see King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, who must be posing for Velázquez as he paints them. The painting is innovative in that the viewer is an active participant in the painting, as if they too are being painted by Velázquez with everyone watching them.

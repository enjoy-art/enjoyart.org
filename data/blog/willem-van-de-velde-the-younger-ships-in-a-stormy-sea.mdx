Willem van de Velde the Younger executed this dramatic image, "Ships in a Stormy Sea" which captures the excitement and danger of sea travel in the 17th century. His father was a prominent painter of naval battle scenes, and the younger Van de Velde's expertise stemmed from first-hand knowledge of sailing. Consequently, his works were highly valued for their realistic depictions of ships and sailing tactics, offering an authentic glimpse into the maritime world of the Dutch Golden Age.

In the painting, the spotlighted ship in the foreground is a kaag, a light fishing vessel. Van de Velde expertly shows this vessel sailing close-hauled in a strong breeze. This particular maneuver is highlighted as a difficult sailing maneuvers, requiring the crew to sail the vessel as directly into the wind as it can go without causing the sails to flap uselessly. The technical accuracy and focus on the difficulty of the task underscore the artist's deep understanding of seamanship.

Seafaring was essential to the economy and power of the Dutch Republic, facilitating fishing, whaling, and extensive global trade with the Americas, Asia, and Africa (which tragically included the trade in enslaved Africans). The dominant Dutch naval fleet was also a source of national pride. Thus, images of ships and maritime activities were a common and powerful subject used to display Dutch prosperity and global influence.

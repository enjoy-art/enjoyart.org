“The Agony in the Garden with the donor Louis I d’Orléans” is probably the central panel of a triptych which is now attributed to Colart de Laon. 

The painting is a portrayal of the biblical narrative depicting Christ’s agonizing prayer on the Mount of Olives with Louis I d’Orléans (nettle leaves sown on his robe and receding hairline) depicted as the donor, participating in Christ’s suffering with the support of Saint Agnes of Rome (lamb) 

It was probably commissioned by Louis I’s widow in memory of her late husband because he -is holding a scroll refering to a funerary psalm.

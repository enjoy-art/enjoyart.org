Egyptian frescos found in tombs often represented scenes from everyday life in the hope the deceased would enjoy those activities in their afterlife and also find the painted objects and food there. In this fresco, Nebamun, who was a middle-ranking official scribe and grain counter at the temple complex in Thebes, is the bigger subject hunting for wild birds in the marshes, probably an activity he enjoyed and is hoping to pursue in his afterlife.

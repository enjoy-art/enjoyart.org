Prior to painting The Foxes in 1913, Marc was inspired by French Cubism and the Orphic works of Robert Delaunay. The Foxes reflects Marc's breakdown of the animals into abstract forms, presented in harmonized colors. The crystalline composition resembles stained glass windows in medieval churches.\n

This \"Portrait of Martin Luther\" is the most recognizable representation of the leader of the Reformation. Cranach was the most successful German artist of his time and he had embraced the Protestant Reformation and befriended Martin Luther so the portrait also had a promotional purpose. Cranach painted Luther so he look strong, smart, and resolute, yet simple and with no flourish. In many ways, it is a portrait of \"your trustworthy, neighborhood pastor\" in opposition to representations of the time of Catholic bishops.

Duccio's Virgin and Child enthroned with Angels is a 4.5 over 2.9-meter panel painting, the largest remaining of the 13th-century. It is currently displayed  in the Galleria degli Uffizi in a similar way as in this book between Cimabue's and Giotto's to show the path towards the Renaissance. In this painting, Duccio puts extra effort to give some depth and some finesse to the characters and the draperies; yet the perspective is off and the painting still seems flat.

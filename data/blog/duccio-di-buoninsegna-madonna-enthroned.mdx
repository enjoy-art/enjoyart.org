* Title: Madonna enthroned (Maestà)
* Artist: Duccio di Buoninsegna (c. 1255-1319)
* Date: 1286
* Medium: Tempera and gold on wood panel
* Dimensions: 450 × 290 cm

Duccio painted a 4.5 by 2.9 m panel, the largest remaining of the 13th-century. It is displayed in the Uffizi Gallery between Cimabue’s and Giotto’s to show the path to the Renaissance. Duccio put extra effort to give some depth and some finesse to the characters and the draperies; yet the perspective is off and the painting still seems flat.

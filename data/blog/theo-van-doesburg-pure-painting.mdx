With this work, Van Doesburg considered that he had achieved his goal- \"a completely flat composition in which the central point is outside the painting\".\n\n\nThis asymmetrical composition characterised by the interlocking colour stripes on a neutral grey background gives an impression of balance and a visual unity. However, the presence in the left corner of the canvas, of a large white square left unfinished ironically disturbs the repetitive character of this pictorial framew ork . The two-coloured frame continues this sensation of unbalance.

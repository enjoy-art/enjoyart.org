The \"Blue Boy\" is striking because of the unusual use of so much blue. The portrait youth appears in clothing from the 17th century and is painted in a similar way to Van Dyck's portraits (see Charles Hunting). The boy's confident and satisfied look makes the viewer think he has the world in his hands.

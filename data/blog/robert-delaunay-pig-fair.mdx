A pair of black-stockinged legs,swept up in a riot of colours, projects the noisy atmosphere of a Roaring Twenties funfair.\nMyriad coloured discs, the artist's favourite motif, seem ta rise from a hat. Their \"tumultuous orchestration\" draws onlookers into a merry-go-round's frantically swirling movement and music. The modern, brightly-lit, colourful city with its new advertising hoardings and popular, entertaining sports are a source of new sensations for the painter. ln the foreground, Robert and Sonia Delaunay's friend Tristan Tzara, the dada poet, signifies the close ties between the painter couple and contemporary poetry.

The \"Portrait of Eleonor of Toledo with her son Giovanni de Medici\" depicts the wife of Cosimo I de Medici, ruler of Florence, sitting with her hand resting on the shoulder of her son, the heir. The portrait seems cold and rigid (blue background, dark earthy colors used, formal dressing, stern facial expressions) without the warmth typically expected of a portrait of mother and child. Such distancing is typical of the Mannerist school's rejection of naturalism. So is Eleanor's elongated hand in the foreground.\nThe painter's skill is demonstrated by how well reproduced are Eleanor's gown of elaborate brocaded velvet with gold weft loops, her belt with pearls and her jewelry, as well as her son's golden threaded, blue shirt.

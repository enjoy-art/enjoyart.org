The painting "The origin of the Milky Way" shows Heracles, also know as Hercules, being pulled away from the breast of Hera, goddess of motherhood and wife of Zeus, that he was suckling. 

Legend has it that the infant Heracles was brought to Hera by his half-sister Athena, who later became known for her role as a goddess of protection. Hera, out of compassion, nursed Heracles, but he suckled so vigorously that he caused her pain, prompting her to push him away. As a result, her milk scattered across the heavens, forming what we now know as the Milky Way. It was believed that through this divine milk, Heracles gained extraordinary powers.

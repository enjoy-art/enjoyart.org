"The Victory of Faith" portrays two women, one Caucasian and the other Black, who have converted to Christianity as shown with the crosses and symbols scratched on the wall above their heads and who are prisoners for their newfound religion. The two women are peacefully asleep on a bed of straw in their dungeon. In the background two lions within a cage are glaring at the two women through its bars.

\"The Great Odalisque\" depicts a reclining odalisque, a concubine, in a fantasy Oriental harem setting in a highly sensuous pose. She is lying naked on a divan with her back to the viewer but with her head turned towards the viewer. Her pale skin is painted very delicately making it feel soft. She is holding a fan made of feathers the purpose of which is ambiguous and adds to the sexual nature of the painting. \n\nThe painting stresses a contrast between the beautiful nude who is a concubine in a lush, sensual environment and that body's unavailability (back and arm hiding her body, idealized soft skin, a glance which is not an invitation, a setting geographically distant). The painting reveals influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino with distorted proportions  (small head, elongated back and limbs, unrealistic curve of the left leg) and a cool color scheme. \n\nThe painting is also one of the most famous \"Orientalist\" paintings. Napoleon's Egyptian expedition of 1798 stimulated great public interest in representations of the Oriental world, whether they be fantasy or real.\n\nThe painting was extremely controversial when it was first exhibited in 1814 but was a commercial success and it marked Ingres' shift from Neoclassicism to exotic Romanticism.

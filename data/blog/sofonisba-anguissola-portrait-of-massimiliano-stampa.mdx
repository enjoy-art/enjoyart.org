An inscription on the back of this striking portrait identifies the boy as the nine-year-old Massimiliano Stampa, third marquis of the small northern Italian city of Soncino. The painting commemorates his inheritance of the title in 1557, when his father died. Black clothing was fashionable in Italian courts during the 16th century. The full-length figure with the column in the background and a faithful dog is typical of aristocratic portraiture and treats the new marquis as an adult. His gloves and sword are expressive of his social status.

In "Allegory of Happiness", Angelo Bronzino depicts a busy yet harmonious scene that encapsulates the concept of happiness. 

Happiness is represented as a woman in the centre of the painting, young and beautiful, holding a caduceus in one hand as a symbol of peace in this case and with her left arm holding a cornucopia overflowing with fruits and flowers, representing abundance and fertility. A cherub is holding a laurel wreath above her head, symbolizing victory and achievement. Cupid is by her side pointing an arrow towards her showing she is blessed with Love.

On her right are the figures of Prudence (two faces, holding a globe with Europe displayed) and Peace (the globe of the harmonious sky). On her left, Justice holding a sword and Fortune recognizable with her wheel. At her feet, slain ennemies.

Happiness is wearing blue and pink colors, often assosciated during the Renaissance with the Virgin Mary, and is sitting on a throne with light coming down on her and a discreet aureola over her head. Bronzino might have tried to bring together the concept of Happiness with the blessing of Mary, Mother to all.

It is believed the painting was commissioned by Cosimo I de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, or by a member of the court for public display. Hence, the allegory itself might be a way of celebrating Cosimo I for the state of happiness and prosperity of Florence.

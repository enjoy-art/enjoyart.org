Happiness is represented as a young woman in the centre of the painting with Cupid as a girl, representing love.[8] Prudence and Justice stand on either side of her, whilst the conquered enemies of peace and Fortune, with her wheel, lie at her feet.[9][10] Graham Smith argues that this ideal state of happiness is Florence, and that it celebrates Cosimo I for the great public well-being of the time.[11]\n

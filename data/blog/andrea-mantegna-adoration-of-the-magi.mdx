Mantegna had a sometimes statuesque style, making his figures cold and rigid, possibly because of his study of Roman archaeology, particularly statues, while an apprentice of the Paduan painter, F. Squarcione, who was an ancient Rome enthusiast and taught many painters (Uccello, Filippo Lippi and Donatello). Mantegna experimented very much with perspective. One of his methods was to lower the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. Also original were his close-up compositions with groups of religious subjects, often with the Virgin Mary (a genre called \"sacra conversazione\"), such as \"Adoration of the Magi\" depicted here. Mantegna is known for the spatial illusionism he used in frescoes, particularly his ceiling decorations, today called \"trompe-oeil\".

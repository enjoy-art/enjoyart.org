The “Adoration of the Magi” is a composition where Mary, with Joseph behind her, is holding new-born Jesus up so he can bless the three Magi who are giving him presents and bowing to him.

Mantegna brings a different perspective to this often-painted scene. The dark background, the close-up technique, and the fact all characters are partly cropped out of the frame except for Jesus make the painting very dense and the interaction of these characters palatable.

Mantegna became known for the spatial illusionism he used in his paintings, particularly in his frescoes on ceilings. His technique was very much used in the Baroque era and are today called “trompe-oeil”.

Is this a modern Eve about to take a bite of the apple? William Glackens certainly counted on his viewers to make that association. Many of his models were young women earning their living in New York by entering the workforce in an expanding labor market. Glackens offered a fresh American update on the subject of the nude studio model by including a modern woman and fashionable contemporary attire. In paraphrasing one of France’s most famous paintings, Édouard Manet’s Olympia, he also aligned this work with one that was daring in its own time.\nNude with Apple is a signature work of Glackens’ post-Ashcan career. It is said to represent the turning point in his style and his division with The Eight. It depicts a model resting on a couch, holding an apple. \"The model's slightly weary but forthright expression, and even the ribbon tied around her neck, call to mind Manet's Olympia...a modern Eve.\"[26] A humorously incongruous touch is her hat, placed on the couch next to her unclothed body as if she had just arrived or was preparing soon to leave. The languid pose, the comfortable interior setting, and the notable attention paid to bright, vivid colors set this painting apart from those of the Ashcan painters. It is interesting to compare the finished work to an earlier study in pastel. Glackens' working method included making numbers of sketches which focused on separate elements of the composition.\ns this a modern Eve about to take a bite of the apple?

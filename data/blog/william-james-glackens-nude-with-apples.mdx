William Glackens cleverly invites viewers to associate his painting, "Nude with Apple," with the notion of a modern-day Eve on the verge of biting into the forbidden fruit. Many of his models were young women engaged in New York's burgeoning labor market, reflecting the evolving roles of women in society. Glackens revitalizes the traditional subject of the nude studio model by portraying a contemporary woman adorned in fashionable attire. By drawing parallels to Ã‰douard Manet's provocative "Olympia," Glackens infuses his work with a daring spirit akin to its predecessor.

"Nude with Apple" stands as a hallmark of Glackens' post-Ashcan career, symbolizing a pivotal moment in his artistic evolution and his departure from the Ashcan group. The model's candid yet composed expression, along with the ribbon around her neck, evoke echoes of Manet's "Olympia," portraying a modern-day Eve figure. An amusingly incongruous touch is the presence of her hat placed beside her unclothed body, suggesting her arrival or imminent departure. The relaxed posture, domestic setting, and vibrant color palette distinguish this painting from the works of the Ashcan painters.

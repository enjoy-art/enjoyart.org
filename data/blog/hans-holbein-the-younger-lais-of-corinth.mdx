This painting depicts the renowned Lais of Corinth, an ancient Greek courtesan known for her high-priced services. The model for this painting, also featured in Holbein's Darmstadt Madonna and Venus and Amor (on the right), is believed to be Magdalena Offenburg, possibly Holbein's mistress.

Holbein's style is reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci and the Lombard muralists, possibly influenced by his visit to Italy. He employs Leonardo's sfumato technique to blend skin tones seamlessly, and utilizes a parapet, like Titian did too, to create depth and distance between the subject and the viewer.

Holbein demonstrated here again how skillful he was with details such as the souffl√© draperies, the knots holding up the sleeves of her dress, the gold threads in her head scarf, and slight  asymetry between her eyes.

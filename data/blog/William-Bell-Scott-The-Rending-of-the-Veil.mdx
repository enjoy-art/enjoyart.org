"The Rending of the Veil"  is a dramatic watercolor and gouache which illustrates the biblical moment from the Gospel of St. Matthew (27:50–51), when the veil of the temple is torn in two at the death of Christ. 

The painting represents the Crucifixion in the far background with the three crosses on the top of a hill and, in the foreground, the high priest and Levites performing a sacrificial ritual.

The composition is rich in symbolism, emphasizing the transition from the old covenant (symbolized by the sacrificial lamb) to the new covenant (symbolized by Christ's sacrifice and resurrection to come with the ray of light). 

The painting was considered one of Scott's finest watercolors and the website Victorian web indicates it was highly praised by contemporaries such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti who described it as "greased lightning".

Scott's interpretation of the biblical event reflects the intellectual and artistic currents of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, emphasizing both historical accuracy and spiritual depth.

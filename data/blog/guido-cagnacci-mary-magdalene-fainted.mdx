Cagnacci shows here his precocious passion for the often languid and seductive representation of female figures. That of Magdalene is actually part of a centuries-old iconographic tradition. The woman, taking refuge in a cave in Provence, renounces worldly pleasures and leads a hermit's life. Beside her she holds the cross, the jar of nard with which she anointed Christ's feet at the Supper of Bethany and, in her hands, the skull of the memento mori and the scourge with which she punishes her own flesh. The saint's fainting, however, whether it be mystical ecstasy or the effects of ascetic privations, does not prevent the painter from exercising - and suggesting - a gaze that does not seem marked by rigorous penance, just as the woman's body does not show the visible signs of mortification.

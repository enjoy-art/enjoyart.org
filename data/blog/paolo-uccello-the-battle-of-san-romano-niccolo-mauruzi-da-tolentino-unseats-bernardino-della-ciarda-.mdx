\"Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda\" is the central painting of a three equally huge paintings that formed a series \"The Battle of San Romano\", used to be hung together in Florence and are now spread in Florence, Paris and London. \n\nThe scene depicts the decisive moment of the battle where the Sienese commander, Bernardino della Carda, in the middle of the painting, is thrown off his white horse by a Florentine horseman (red colors). \n\nThe flat background with animals and scenes is reminiscent of pre-Renaissance techniques. But the energy that is expressed in the painting is striking with the victor's lance cutting through the painting, the defeated horseman about to fall, and the horse behind kicking backwards. Also remarkable is the complex perspectival framework and the sense of energy that derives from the lances in the foreground and in the background and those broken on the ground, and also the aquebuses pointed in the air.

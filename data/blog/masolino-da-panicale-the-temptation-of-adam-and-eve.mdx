In the same chapel as Masaccio's Expulsion of the progenitors from Eden, there is another work with a \"related\" theme- The Temptation of Adam and Eve or Original Sin, a work by Masolino from around 1424-1425. The fresco shows a famous scene from the Old Testament, namely when the serpent from the book of Genesis tries to convince Adam and Eve to break the rules. This episode, set in the late Gothic style, is characterized by the light, which shapes the figures in a soft and enveloping way, just as if they emanated a diffuse glow. In addition, the dark background enhances the sensual plasticity of the nudes of the two sinners.

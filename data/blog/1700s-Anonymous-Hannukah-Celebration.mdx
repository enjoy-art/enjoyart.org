This Hanukkah Family Scene from the 18th century is an anonymous oil painting that portrays a Jewish man carrying a child and being pulled by his daughter towards a Hanukkah menorah, kindling the festival lights. The older daughter is holding a red object in her hand.

The scene is set in a candlelit interior, with family members dressed in period-appropriate clothing. 

The painting captures the intimacy of traditional Jewish family life during the 18th century, emphasizing the cultural and religious significance of Hanukkah.

The setting is very barren with only black and white checkered tiles and a table covered with a white cloth on which there is a makeshift menorah holding seven lit candles. A black pillar marks a separation of the space into two volumes.

The artwork is characterized by its realistic style, rich colors, and fine brushwork, which bring to life the textures of the clothing, furniture, and the glow of the menorah. The composition reflects the customs and domestic rituals of the time, offering a glimpse into the daily life and traditions of Jewish families in the 1700s.

The artist of this painting is anonymous, as is common with many genre paintings from the 18th century. During this period, Jewish life and customs were often documented by both Jewish and non-Jewish artists, though few works were signed or attributed to specific painters.

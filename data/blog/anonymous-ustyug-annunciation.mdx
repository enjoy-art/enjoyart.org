The making of icons in Ancient Rus’ started when the East Slavs converted to Orthodox Christianity which is said to have happened when Vladimir the great was baptized in Kiev in 988 AD. 

“Annunciation of Ustyug” is one of the few Russian icons which survived the Mongol invasion of Rus’ in the 13th century. The Virgin Mary already carries Jesus in her womb.

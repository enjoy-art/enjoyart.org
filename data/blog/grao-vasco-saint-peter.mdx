“Saint Peter” by Vagos depicts the saint at the centre of a symmetrical composition, sitting on an ornate pontifical throne, making the blessing gesture toward the viewer, dressed in full papal regalia. Indeed, Peter, one of Jesus’ disciples, was the founding father of the church of Rome and, as such, the first pope. On the left side, Jesus calling Peter and Andrew to become his disciples. On the right side, the scene "Quo vadis?", as the risen Jesus appears to Peter.

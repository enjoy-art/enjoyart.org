The painting \"Saint Peter\" was commissioned by Dom Miguel da Silva, who was to become bishop of Viseu and who had been ambassador in Rome, to serve as an altarpiece for the Viseu Cathedral. Saint Peter is at the center of the symmetrical composition, sitting on an ornate Italianate pontifical throne making the blessing gesture toward the viewer, in full Papal regalia. On either side of the throne- left, Jesus calling Peter and Andrew to become his disciples; right, Jesus carrying the cross. \nThe influence is both Flemish with the minute details, the crisp representation of St Peter which resembles a portrait, the rich textiles, the many symbols, and Italian with the great work on the background scenery and the extensive use of chiaroscuro (strong contrasts between light and dark).

The details are plentiful and painted with very fine and precise brushstrokes- the angel’s and Mary’s drapes; the great variety and accurateness in the plants in the garden. The vanishing point is inside the home and not outside focusing the viewer’s attention on the Annunciation. And notice- Eve is looking straight at the viewer.

The fresco's composition is very simple with only Mary greeting the blessing and news from the Archangel Gabriel, with no other distraction. The bareness of the setting makes one feel great harmony which is reinforced by the use mostly of a warm, earthy color and a play on tones which is most striking in the dégradé of the angel’s wings.

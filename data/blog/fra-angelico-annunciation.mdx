Two representations of the Annunciation by Fra Angelico a few years apart and on different supports. \n\nThe painting on top and earlier is more complex, very fine, precise paint brush strokes, particularly the angel's drapes; research put in being accurate about plants painted; use of colors mixing cold and bright colors and the soft pink of the angel with the more grounding blue of Mary. Eve looking straight at us. The vanishing point is inside the home and not outside focusing the viewer's attention on the Annunciation.\n\nThe fresco at the bottom shares many similarities with the painting on top but greatly simplified, leaving just Mary greeting the blessing and news from the Archangel Gabriel, with no other distraction. The bottom fresco reaches a sense of pure perfection with the exactitude in the perspective through the window in the background, the flawless and candid faces and the intricate details of the angel's wings.

The painting "Bacchus and Ariadne," also known as "Ariadne in Naxos," portrays the mythological moment when the Roman god Bacchus, known as Dionysus in Greek mythology, discovers Ariadne sleeping on the island of Naxos and becomes enamored with her.

In Greco-Roman mythology, Ariadne was a princess from Crete, the daughter of King Minos. She famously aided Theseus in escaping the labyrinth and the Minotaur. However, Theseus later abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos. It was there that Dionysus encountered Ariadne asleep, fell deeply in love with her, and eventually marrying her.

In typical Orthodox iconography, the archangel Gabriel is shown running to Mary and holding a staff like a messenger, with his right hand extended toward Mary to deliver the blessing sent by God for her. Mary is sitting on an elevated seat on the right of the painting. She is holding scarlet yarn in one hand, because there is a belief that Mary, as a child, was involved in weaving the great temple veil, while her other hand is raised to accept the Archangelâ€™s message. The Holy Spirit is descending on her. Also her dark garment covers her from head to toe and bears three stars to symbolize the Holy Trinity.

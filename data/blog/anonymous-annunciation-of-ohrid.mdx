In typical orthodox iconography, Archangel Gabriel is shown running to Mary and holding a staff like a messenger, with his right hand extended toward Mary to deliver the blessing sent by God for her. Mary is sitted on an elevated seat on the right of the painting. She is holding scarlet yarn in one hand, as she was assigned to prepare for the veil for the Temple of Jerusalem, while her other hand is raised to accept the Archangelâ€™s message. The Holy Spirit is descending on her. Also her dark garment covers her from head to toe and bears three stars to symbolize the Holy Trinity.

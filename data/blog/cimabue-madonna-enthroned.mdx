Cimabue's \"Madonna Enthroned\" respects the Hodegetria archetype and the byzantine iconography - the Virgin pointing toward Jesus, scenes and forms are mostly flat, the symmetry, the use of gold, the massive throne, etc. Yet Cimabue's figures were depicted with more lifelike proportions, more individualized, human traits and use of shading to give some volume.

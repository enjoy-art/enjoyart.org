The Ottoman tughra stands as a calligraphic symbol of the sultan's authority, mandated to be present in all official documents including royal decrees, endowment papers, correspondence, and coins. Its origins trace back to its inaugural usage by the first Ottoman sultan in 1324, evolving over time into a more intricate form characterized by three vertical shafts and two concentric oval loops on the left.

Comprising the name of the reigning sultan, his father's name, his title, and the phrase "the eternally victorious," this distinctive calligraphic emblem posed challenges in readability and replication. Consequently, a designated court artist was tasked with crafting the standardized, unadorned tughra, while a court illuminator collaborated to embellish select imperial documents with intricate scroll designs and naturalistic floral motifs. The illuminator's delicate touches complement the graceful lines of calligraphy, yielding a vibrant and voluminous effect.

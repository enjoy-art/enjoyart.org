This woman at her toilet,a traditionally peaceful and intimate scene, is animated here by a strange instability.\n\n\nThe tight framing, the rough-and-ready perspective, the blue that seems to invade the space and the astonishing reflection with no bearing at all on the posture of Erna Schilling, the painter's companion, combine ta create a dramatic tension. Although the works of the French Cubists exhibited in Cologne in 1912 no doubt influenced Kirchner, the razor-sharp drawing and the acute angles also testify ta his interest in German Gothic art, particularly wood engravings. Painted in 1913, the work was slightly modified by the artist seven years later.

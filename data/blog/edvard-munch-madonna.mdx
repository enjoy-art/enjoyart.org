In "Madonna", Edvard Munch shows us a woman who might be in the act of making love with the viewer; else a woman in some sort of transe.

Madonna is the usual title given to several versions of a composition by the Norwegian expressionist painter Edvard Munch showing a bare-breasted half-length female figure created between 1892 and 1895 using oil paint on canvas. He also produced versions in print form.

The title of the painting makes us think of the Virgin Mary. So does the halo around her body.

In "A Lady in her Bath," Clouet depicts a woman sitting in her bath and other activities in the background. 

The principal subject may be Diane de Poitiers, who was mistress of King Henry II of France from when she was 35 and he was 15. Is it possible the young boy going for grapes is a young Henry II? 

The woman is shown in a relaxed and contemplative state, with her gaze directed downward, lost in thought. 

It is not clear who the child being nursed in the background is given Diane de Poitiers and Henry II did not have a child together. If it is Diane's child it would be one of the two daughters she had at 18 and 21, which would also fit with the young age of the principal subject.

In the background, a maid is removing a pitcher of water from the fire to pour hot water into the woman's bath.

The painting is notable for its sensuality and realism.

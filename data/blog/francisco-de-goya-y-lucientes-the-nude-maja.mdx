“The Naked Maja” also known as "the Nude Maja" by Francisco Goya was a very controversial painting at the time, showcasing the artist’s bold exploration of sensuality and of the female form. One reason the painting was so controversial is that it was an unapologetic portrait of a nude woman, without hiding behind the false pretense of mythology or religion. The word "naked" better conveys the simple  and barren station of the woman depicted than the word "nude" which would mean to drape her with a veil of unrealness.

“The Naked Maja” features a reclining nude woman in a provocative pose, gazing directly at the viewer with an air of confidence and defiance. The woman’s figure is rendered with remarkable realism and detail whereas typical paintings of the time would  depict nude figures in idealized or allegorical contexts. Hence, by presenting the nude woman in a straightforward and confrontational manner, Goya challenged societal norms and sparked debate about the role of art in representing human sexuality.

The woman’s direct gaze challenges the viewer, inviting them to confront their own attitudes towards sexuality and the human body. The painting thus explores the themes of desire, power, and identity.

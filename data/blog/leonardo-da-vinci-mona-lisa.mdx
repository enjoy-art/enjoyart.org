The “Mona Lisa” depicts noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, wife of del Giocondo. Leonardo painted it and never parted with it, even when he moved to France. At his death it was acquired by King Francois Ier. 

The painting is particularly famous for the subject’s enigmatic expression, due in particular to the soft transition between colors technique (aka sfumato) used around the lips and the eyes. 

The Gioconda holds herself with a benevolent demeanor and smiles peacefully. She radiates serenity. One can think of an idealized womanly, protective figure, like the Virgin Mary, or the perfect Mother.

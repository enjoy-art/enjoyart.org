The Mona Lisa depicts Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, wife of del Giocondo, which is the reason the painting is also known La Gioconda and la Joconde. Leonardo never parted with this- he painted it between 1503 and 1506, took it with him when he moved to France, and perhaps continued working on it until 1517. At his death it was acquired by King Francois I of France. The painting is particularly famous for the subject's enigmatic expression, due in particular to the soft transition between colors technique (aka sfumato) used around the lips and the eyes. Viewers marvel at how Mona Lisa's eyes follows their eyes as they move; it is not the first painting where a character looks back at the viewer, but it is one of the first for a portrait. \nThe way the Gioconda holds herself, is dressed and has such a serene and benevolent demeanor, one can think of a modern protective figure, a modern Virgin Mary.

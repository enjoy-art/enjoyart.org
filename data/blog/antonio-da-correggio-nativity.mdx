The painting “Nativity” shows Jesus held by Mary in the manger. Jesus is the source of light glowing on the characters around him. The shepherd, the women and the angels above are all excited. In contrast, the calmness of Mary and Jesus in the glow of Jesus creates a unique mother-child bond. Corregio was a precursor of Baroque with his “à la chandelle” style which is a greatly stressed chiaroscuro (light/dark) treatment of light.

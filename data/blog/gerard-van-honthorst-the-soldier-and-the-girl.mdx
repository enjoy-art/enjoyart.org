A close-up couple appears against a dark background; the young woman kindles the embers of the burning charcoal she is holding with tongs in order to light her candle. The young man in Landsknecht costume looks at her with delight and lasciviously, while he clasps her bare breast with his hand. The allegorical depiction is to be understood as a moralizing warning of the dangers of love, especially lust. However, the clearly erotic painting also conveys a sensual pleasure through the sophisticated lighting, the fine color nuances and the realism. Strongly influenced by Caravaggio's works, Gerard van Honthorst was the main representative of the \"Utrecht Caravaggists\".

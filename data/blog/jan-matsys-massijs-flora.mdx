The painting "Flora" portrays the Roman goddess of flowers and prosperity, depicted seated tranquilly in a garden while delicately holding a small bouquet of red and white carnations, symbolizing love and good fortune. Positioned strategically within the composition, these flowers seem to float above a distant landscape featuring the port of Antwerp along the River Scheldt. This serene scene serves as an allegory of the peace and prosperity of the city, with Flora seemingly bestowing her own blessing upon it.

According to Wikipedia, although Jan Massys was known for his portrayal of the female nude, often executed in a style reminiscent of the Fontainebleau school, it is speculated that his brother Cornelis, a specialist in landscapes, may have been responsible for depicting the view of Antwerp in the painting.

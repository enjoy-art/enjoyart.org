The life of Emma Lady Hamilton, whose beauty and vivacious character took her from humble origins as the daughter of an illiterate blacksmith to become the mistress and later wife of the diplomat, antiquarian, collector and vulcanologist Sir William Hamilton (1730-1803), the King's Minister Plenipotentiary at the Bourbon Court in Naples, and later mistress of the celebrated naval hero, Lord Horatio Nelson, was both extraordinary and, in the end, tragic. The beauty that captured the hearts of both Hamilton and Nelson exerted a similarly magnetic attraction on the imagination of several of the leading artists of the day and none more than Romney.\nIn this portrait Romney portrays Lady Hamilton as Cassandra, daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy in Greek mythology. Cassandra's beauty caused the God Apollo to grant her the gift of prophecy, but when she failed to return his love Apollo put a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions. Combining deep understanding with powerlessness, Cassandra exemplified the tragic condition of mankind.

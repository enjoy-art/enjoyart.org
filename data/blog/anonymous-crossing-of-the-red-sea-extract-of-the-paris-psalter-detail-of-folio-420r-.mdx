The Paris Psalter (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS. gr. 139) is a Byzantine illuminated manuscript, 38 x 26.5 cm in size, containing 449 folios and 14 full-page miniatures. The Paris Psalter is considered a key monument of the so-called Macedonian Renaissance, a 10th-century renewal of interest in classical art closely identified with the emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (909-959) and his immediate successors.\nThe manuscript’s importance in art history is based on the 14 superb, full-page illuminations that illustrate its texts. These singleton pages were tipped in to the manuscript and are not part of its regular gathering structure. The first seven images preceding the text depict scenes from the life of David, the author of the psalms, who is usually accompanied by personifications. The eighth miniature marks the beginning of the penitential Psalms; and the last 6, depicting Moses, Jonah, Hannah, Ezekiel and Hezekiah, introduce and illustrate the Canticles of the Old Testament. \n419v- Moses parting the Red Sea, with personifications of the desert, night, the abyss, and the Red Sea;\n\n Miniature 9 (main a), la traversée de la Mer Rouge, sur deux registres. Le détail présenté est la Mer Rouge qui se referme sur le Pharaon et son armée, l'Abîme personnifié (βυθός) se saisissant du Pharaon devant l'allégorie de la Mer Rouge (ἐρυθρὰ θαλαση [!]).

This small triptych was not intended to be an image for religious retreat. It shows three of the main ways to meditate on sacred images. Once in the center through the contact with the Virgin Mary, then through the approach to the saints in the left panel and finally through the meditation on the sufferings of Jesus Christ on the right. Depicted by the scenes of the flagellation in the lower field and those of the crucifixion in the upper field.

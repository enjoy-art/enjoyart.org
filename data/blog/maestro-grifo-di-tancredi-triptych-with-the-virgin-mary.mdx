"Triptych with the Virgin Mary" is a relatively small triptych which was probably not intended for a collective use but for personal prayers. The triptych shows three of the main ways to meditate on sacred images- 1) in the center through making contact with the Virgin Mary; 2) through the saints' intercession in the left panel; 3) through meditation on the sufferings of Jesus Christ on the right which are depicted for the viewer (flagellation in the lower field and crucifixion in the upper field).

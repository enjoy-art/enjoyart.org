\"Mary and Child\" used to be the right panel of the Melun Diptych. Jean Fouquet was the first known French painter to have traveled to Italy and was also aware of the works of Flemish primitives. In this painting, Fouquet brought together these traditions to launch the French Renaissance- 1) from the Italian Proto-Renaissance, the composition of the Madonna enthroned and absence of background; 2) from the Flemish Primitives, he included minute details such as the reflections of windows in the ornaments on the throne, the textiles made tangible and Madonna being a portrait of the most beautiful woman of the time, Agn√®s Sorel.

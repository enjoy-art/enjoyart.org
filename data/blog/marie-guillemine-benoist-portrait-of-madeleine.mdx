\"Portrait of Madeleine\" was exhibited in 1800 at the Salon. It was one of the first paintings where a Black person was the principal or sole subject, and particularly in a way promoting equality at a time where slavery still existed in much of the world, though the French Revolution had banned it in its colonies. \nMadeleine, beautiful and serene, is looking straight at the viewer in a soft way- the artist sees her as an equal person who is simply superiorly beautiful. Her white clothing, a single breast exposed and the belt over her belly are symbols of fertility.\nMarie-Guillemine Benoist was trained by Élisabeth Vigée Lebrun, a master of portraits, and by David, the master of Neo-classicism. She was a neo-classicist, with a stong personal feminist touch.

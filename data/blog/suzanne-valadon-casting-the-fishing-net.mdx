Valadon was infatuated with the young artist André Utter, a friend of her son who was 25 years younger than Valadon, and who became her lover. They got married in 1914, when the painting was made. It is Utter who is depicted on the canvas, as a naked man, standing in three different poses and who reproduces the same gesture in each of them. He embodies youth; the canvas emphasizes the power of the model, in the action of casting a fishing net. The net actually serves as a pretext for depicting his naked body tense with effort. In the first two positions, the man leans on his left leg. The model's athletic body further enhances the erotic nature of the composition.[3]\nThe canvas represents a classical composition on an academic theme and has a geometric design. This study of movement is reminiscent of the painting Dance (1910) by Henri Matisse (Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). The pink mountain and the blue lake were inspired by the artist's stay in Corsica and are also reminiscent of Paul Cézanne's tones.\n\nThe artist uses outline, clearly delineating the silhouette of the model in space, a technique previously used, among others, by Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The colors of the painting are warm and sensual.[4]\n\nThis is also the last painting where Valadon depicted a male nude. Subsequently, she became more interested in female and child nudes. Valadon was perceived as a symbol of a liberated and active woman, depicting a man as an object of desire. She breaks with the bourgeois conventions of her time by marrying a younger man and by depicting the male nude in her work.\nValadon was not confined to a specific style, yet both Symbolist and Post-Impressionist aesthetics are clearly demonstrated within her work.[33] She worked primarily with oil paint, oil pencils, pastels, and red chalk; she did not use ink or watercolor because these mediums were too fluid for her preference.[34] Valadon's paintings feature rich colors and bold, open brushwork often featuring firm black lines to define and outline her figures.[1]\n\nValadon's self-portraits, portraits, nudes, landscapes, and still lifes remain detached from trends and contemporaneous aspects of academic art.[35] The subjects of Valadon's paintings often reinvent the old master themes- women bathing, reclining nudes, and interior scenes. She preferred to paint working-class models. Art historian Patricia Mathews suggests that Valadon's working-class status and experience as a model influenced her intimate, familiar observation of these women and their bodies. In this respect she differed from Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, who painted mostly women, but \"remained well within the bounds of propriety in their subject matter\" because of their upper-middle-class status in French society.[30][page needed] Valadon's marginalized status allowed her to enter the contemporary male dominated domain of art through modeling and her lack of formal academic training may have made her less influenced by academic conventions.[36] She has been noted for that difference in her paintings of the nude women.[37] She resisted typical depictions of women, emphasizing class trappings and their sexual attractiveness, through her realistic depiction of unidealised and self-possessed women who are not overly sexualised.[38] She also painted many nude self-portraits across the span of her career, the later of which displayed her aging body realistically.\n\nValadon emphasized the importance of the composition of her portraits over techniques such as painting expressive eyes.[34] Her later works, such as Blue Room (1923), are brighter in color and show a new emphasis on decorative backgrounds and patterned materials.

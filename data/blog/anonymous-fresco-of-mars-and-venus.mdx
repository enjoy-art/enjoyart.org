The \"Fresco of Mars and Venus\" depicts the Roman gods who are associated respectively with war and love. In the Greek-Roman mythology, Mars and Venus form a couple and Cupid is considered to be their love child. Cupid appears sometimes in multiples which seems to be the case here with one Cupid playing with Mars' sword and the other with his helmet. Contrary to Greek art where only men were painted nude, in Roman art, women can also be painted nude and their body idealized, as it is the case here with this nude Venus who takes centerpiece with Mars behind her.

Artemisia Gentileschi's depiction of Judith's beheading is similar in many respects but the composition is different with the servant helping more and the bodies are even larger, particularly that of Holofernes who seems extremely big and heavy and big. Also and the look on Judith's face is multi-fold but does seem to include a sense of satisfaction from beheading Holofernes; perhaps that is because Artemisia was victim of a rape when she was eighteen.

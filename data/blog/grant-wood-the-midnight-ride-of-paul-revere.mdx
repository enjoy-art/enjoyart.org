The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere is a 1931 painting by the American artist Grant Wood. It depicts the American patriot Paul Revere during his midnight ride on April 18, 1775. The perspective is from a high altitude as Revere rides through a brightly lit Lexington, Massachusetts. It was inspired by the poem \"Paul Revere's Ride\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.[1] Wood used a child's hobby horse as model for Revere's horse.[2]

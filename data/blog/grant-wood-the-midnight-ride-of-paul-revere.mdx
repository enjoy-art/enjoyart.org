"The midnight ride of Paul Revere" is a 1931 painting by the American artist Grant Wood. It depicts the American patriot Paul Revere during his midnight ride on April 18, 1775. The perspective is from a high altitude, with a very large angle,as Revere rides through a brightly lit Lexington, Massachusetts. It was inspired by the poem "Paul Revere's Ride" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Springtime was painted by Cot in 1873. The painting was first exhibited at the 1873 Paris salon, where it was well received; the work would go on to become Cot's most successful work of art, and was often copied in other mediums.[1] In terms of the painting itself, Cot's work depicts a young couple locked in an embrace on a swing amid a forest or garden. The two are wearing classical garb, and are seemingly enthralled by each other, described by one source as \"drunken with first love\".[\nThis flirtatious duo in classicizing dress, painted with notable technical finesse, reflects Cot’s allegiance to the academic style of his teachers, including Bouguereau and Cabanel. Exhibited at the Salon of 1873, the picture was Cot’s greatest success, widely admired and copied in engravings, fans, porcelains, and tapestries. Its first owner, hardware tycoon John Wolfe, awarded the work a prime spot in his Manhattan mansion, where visitors delighted in \"this reveling pair of children, drunken with first love ... this Arcadian idyll, peppered with French spice.\" Wolfe’s cousin, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, later commissioned a similar scene from Cot, The Storm, now also in The Met’s collection (87.15.134).

\"The Miracle of a Dominican Saint\" comes slightly after the death of Guardi's brother, Gian Antonio, with whom he had painted religious paintings and is his last or close to his last religious painting. Guardi then focused on representing historical events of Venice and on painting cityscapes (vedute genre) of Venice, influenced by Canaletto's works and success. \nIt is unclear what event is represented here. In the center, a Dominican friar, recognizable because of the white robe with a black cape, is walking on water while pulling out a man drowning like several others. Their hats and walking sticks suggest they might be pilgrims who fell in the water because a bridge collapsed. However a sunken ship might also be involved- is that a broken mast and a sail on the left? Hence, the painting might represent a miracle by Saint Dominic himself who is said in 1211 to have saved English pilgrims on their way to Compostela when their boat capsized while crossing the River Garonne (cf opeast.org). \nThe theme is religious which roots the painting in the Baroques styles. Yet the rendering is closer to Romanticism with the dramatization of despair versus hope, the loose brushstroke, the ragged clothes, and the expressions on the faces. There is a bit of \"The Medusa Raft\" in this work.

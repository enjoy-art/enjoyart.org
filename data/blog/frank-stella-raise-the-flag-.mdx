The use of basic geometric systems in the work is regarded by many as the precursor of Minimalism. The painting was made by marking equal subdivisions along the sides, bottom and top edges of the canvas and using these intervals to generate simple, symmetrical patterns consisting of bands of black enamel paint separated by thin lines of unpainted canvas.\n\nStella gave the work a provocative title, Die Fahne Hoch!, which means Raise the Flag!, in German, that is taken from the anthem of the Nazi Party, the \"Horst Wessel Song\", and is one of three paintings in the series that make direct reference to Nazism. By applying a hotly emotive title to the image, Stella's ironic purpose was that of destabilizing the idea of meaning itself.

This \"Self-portrait\" of Judith Leyster was offered in 1633 as a masterpiece to the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke, probably when she was admitted in the guild, a rare (maybe a first) privilege at the time for a woman. \n\nLeyster's self-portrait was very relaxed for the time and has a welcoming quality to it- she is turned partially to the viewer with her lips parted as a smile, which is unusual for a painting of the time; her attitude is casual and self-confident; and, she is looking towards the viewer in a friendly way. The joviality of the painting she was working on adds to the overall feeling of good humor. Leyster wore a formal velvet dress and a wide lace collar to look her best and to show how successful an artist she was though she would not have painted dressed as elegantly.

Kirchner's half-nude painting shows Doris Große, known as Dodo, with whom he was together from 1909 to 1911, when he moved from Dresden to Berlin. Doris Große was a milliner and was a designer of extravagant hats for women. The painting depicts her partially undressed, wearing a hat, and with an absent look. In addition to influences from French Fauvism, in which the motif of a beautiful woman with a hat often appeared, the sparse lines of the drawing and the restrained color scheme are elements taken from non-European art. In contrast to comparable depictions of passive sensuality in paintings of the female nude by Henri Matisse, the woman in Kirchner's painting has a more tense and conscious posture, as he knew from the depictions of the Indian wall paintings in Ajanta. He also abandoned the two-dimensionality he had previously practiced in favor of a more plastic visual effect.

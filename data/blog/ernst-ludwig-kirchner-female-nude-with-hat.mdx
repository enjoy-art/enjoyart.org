Kirchner's semi-nude portrait "Female nude with hat" features Doris Große, affectionately known as Dodo, his partner from 1909 to 1911. Doris was renowned for designing extravagant hats for women. In the painting, she is depicted partially disrobed, adorned with one of her striking creations, her gaze distant. Kirchner's subject exudes a more self-aware demeanor, made more tense with the striking contrast between the palor of Doris's skin and the vivd colors of her makeup and of the background.

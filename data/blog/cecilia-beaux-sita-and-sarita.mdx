Cecilia Beaux pictures her cousin Sarah (identified with the Spanish derivation of her given name, Sarita) seated on a sofa with her feline companion, Sita (Spanish for “little one”), in a moment of repose and reflection. You can imagine the cat’s slight weight on the woman’s shoulder, soft fur brushing her ear, while she absently reaches up to scratch the cat in turn. The understanding between the woman and her pet is underscored by the play of their names as well as their two sets of eyes in alignment- the cat looks out at us, while Sarita’s gaze is distant. Hair and fur pelt—glossy and dark—also blend together. The portrayal of a relaxed and intimate moment at home suggests a level of trust between the two women, sitter and painter. Beaux was a successful independent portraitist, among the few self-supporting women artists of the early 20th century. She traveled to Europe to pursue artistic training, spending time in Spain as well as France and England. What words would you use to describe the subject of this painting? Would you identify this work as an act of feminism? Why or why not?

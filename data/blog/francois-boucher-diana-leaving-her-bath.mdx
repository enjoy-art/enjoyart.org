In “Diana leaving her bath”, Diana, the goddess of the hunt and the Moon, can be recognized thanks to the arrows and the hunted hare and pheasant, as well as with her Moon hair brooch. Diana is nude, sitting on white silks that enhance her fair complexion and blonde hair. The nymph to her side has darker hair and a blue hairband in her hair which might make her Egeria, the water nymph, and a servant of Diana. The bright skin tones acquire reddish reflections, in contrast to the bluish green of the landscape.

Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and pastoral scenes. He was perhaps the most celebrated painter and decorative artist of the 18th century.

Antonello da Messina's style is remarkable for its union of Italian simplicity with Flemish concern for detail. Despite no documentary evidence that he ever travelled beyond Italy, he is credited with bringing Flemish techniques and Vasari (16th century painter and historian of the Renaissance) credited him with introducing oil painting into Italy.\n\nWere this painting a Flemish portrait there typically would be extra details put on the background or the context of the main character. But still the dark, uniform background has through time been a characteristic of some Flemish portraits, such as Vermeer's girl with a pearl earing?

Egon Schiele's family is a post-First world war mix of social awareness and the trio represents his family.

Commonly understood as Schiele (seated), Edith (behind him), and a child. The child is symbolic: the work began as Crouching Couple and the baby was added later, likely reflecting the couple’s hoped-for family.
